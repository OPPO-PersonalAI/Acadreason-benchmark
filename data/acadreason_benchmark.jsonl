{"task_id": 1, "domain": "philosophy", "title": "Two sorts of philosophical therapy Ordinary language philosophy, social criticism and the Frankfurt school", "query": "Why is it said that the first generation of the Frankfurt School has practised a sort of a sort of ‘linguistic turn’ and ‘non-quietistic’ philosophical therapy？", "golden_truth": "1.Freyenhagen on the 'Linguistic Turn' in Horkheimer and Adorno | Freyenhagen makes his claims regarding a 'linguistic turn' in FGFS in the context of the 'Classic Objection' to FGFS theory: Habermas's suggestion, that what Adorno and his generation were doing was 'self-undermining' because, 'by engaging in a (purportedly) totalizing critique of modern reason, it makes itself impossible. | For Freyenhagen, The Eclipse of Reason by Horkheimer refers to the eclipse of non-instrumental, 'objective' reason, which is supposed to be somehow a property of the world, by its 'subjective' double. The realm of 'objective reason' would be Horkheimer's term for things like facts about the human species – what determines, ultimately, what it would be for us to live well (or badly). Objection reason–or at any rate, certain of its claims – has been forgotten, and this has allowed the subjective reason of individual thinking subjects to run rampant – with increasingly disastrous results. Here is where the 'linguistic turn' comes in. | Freyenhagen opts to read Horkheimer's remarks about language and objective reason through the prism of the later Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein bears strong affinities with the Aristotelian Adorno and the FGFS linguistic turn. For Freyenhagen, the idea is that by reading Eclipse of Reason through Wittgenstein, we can arrive at a position whereby 'as inseparable from the human life form, language contains traces of \"the structure of the reality\" of this life form, and thus, of (at least part of) objective reason'.This is how the FGFS intend to accomplish their critique of (subjective) reason: by mining language, as a specifically human practice, for the fragments of objective, human rationality inevitably sedimented in it. | 2.Marcuse contra analytic philosophy | The general thrust of Marcuse's critique is that analytic philosophy is 'positive', where thought proper ought to be 'negative'. Marcuse believes that philosophy ought to be able to engage in the emancipatory critique of society and culture as it presently exists. Analytic philosophy, by contrast, seeks to purge thought of any of the resources that we need in order for this critique to take place. | According to Marcuse, analytic philosophy works against the real ends of philosophical thought in two related ways. The first is that it insists on sticking to the analysis of 'ordinary language'. This obsession with 'ordinary discourse' is 'the token of a false concreteness', and it mutilates life as lived rather than confining philosophical inquiry to the stuff of 'real life'. The second is its commitment to 'philosophy as therapy'which tends to a certain quietism that is distinctively Wittgensteinian. As Marcuse has it, by focussing their efforts on exorcising philosophical thought as such, analytic philosophy ends up 'creat[ing] more illusory problems than it has destroyed'. All 'therapeutic philosophy' amounts to, in the end, is a repression. | 3.In Marcuse's account, 'good' forms of ordinary language philosophy, and 'good' forms of philosophy as therapy | Marcuse implicitly distinguishes between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of ordinary language philosophy, as well as between \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of philosophy understood as therapy. Marcuse indicates that he believes that language has some sort of rationality other than the public, surface-level one 'hidden' inside it. By analysing language, then, we can figure out some deep truth about the world in which it has been uttered, or written. The 'good' sort of ordinary language philosophy consists in the attempt to do just this. | For Marcuse, the patron saint of the 'good' sort of ordinary language philosophy is Karl Kraus, and what is important is that Kraus shows 'how an \"internal\" examination of speech and writing, of punctuation, even of typographical errors can reveal a whole moral or political system'. | What Kraus teaches us is that we can only properly understand 'ordinary' discourse, 'ordinary' life if we assume something like an 'extra-linguistic' perspective. Ordinary language philosophy therefore must reside in the realm of the political, of the moral – or at the very least the aesthetic. | Conclusion:'The real universe of ordinary language', Marcuse proclaims, 'is the struggle for existence'. The 'good' sort of ordinary language philosophy is able to show up, to cast judgement on. | 4. Philosophical therapy from the standpoint of redemption | Marcuse's identification of a way in which philosophy as therapy might be made to serve the interests of emancipatory critique: we ought to 'clarify' concepts by showing how their subjective meaning, how they appear from the perspective of 'subjective reason', fails to match up with how things 'objectively' are. | For Marcuse, such 'emancipatory' clarification 'may well fulfil a therapeutic function, and if philosophy would become therapeutic, it would really come into its own'. | Conclusion 1: Marcuse's criticisms of Wittgenstein's version of 'philosophical therapy', are really just directed at his choice of patient. The 'good' sort of philosophical therapy in fact aims at essentially the same thing as the 'bad' version did: it seeks to get reality in view. | The'philosophical therapy' that Adorno is pursuing in Minima Moralia is not only aimed at the clarification of what is 'really' there. Rather, it aims at just what Marcuse tells us the true therapist should: to clarify what is really there, in order to be able to grasp how it might otherwise be. | Conclusion 2: Adorno, and other FGFS thinkers, were, at least at times, engaged in the therapeutic analysis of 'ordinary' language and experience, clarifying the true meaning and significance of our everyday experience of the world in light of some 'objective reason' that is itself linguistic in nature, grounded in some notion of the human species analogous to that which Wittgenstein names with the idea of the human 'form of life'.", "checklist": "1.Does the answer involve Fabian Freyenhagen’s interpretation of Horkheimer’s views through the lens of Wittgenstein? | 2.Does the answer include Fabian Freyenhagen’s view that the first generation of the Frankfurt School should be understood as part of the linguistic turn? | 3.Does the answer include Herbert Marcuse’s critique of analytic philosophy? | 4.Does the answer include Herbert Marcuse’s view on the ‘good’ forms of ordinary language philosophy and ‘good’ forms of philosophy understood as therapy? | 5.Does the answer include the comments of Karl Kraus by Benjamin, Adorno, and Marcuse? | 6.Does the answer include Marcuse’s view on how “philosophy as therapy” can be made to serve the interests of emancipatory critique? | 7.Does the answer include the view that the first generation of the Frankfurt School have practised a form of ‘non-quietistic’ philosophical therapy?", "num_checklist": 7, "hints_background": "1.In Fabian Freyenhagen 2023 study, he argues that there is a sort of ‘linguistic turn’ in First-Generation Frankfurt School, and here comes the affinities between the FGFS, and later Wittgenstein.

{"task_id": 2, "domain": "philosophy", "title": "Once more, without feeling", "query": "Why both welfare subjectivity and autonomy can confer moral status, and what's the relationship between them?", "golden_truth": "1.Point out the key issue | Are there metaphysically and/or nomologically possible beings who fall outside the scope of the morality of humanity and are protected only by the morality of respect – individuals whose autonomy merits respect but who are not welfare subjects? If so, what does this imply about the relationship between moral standing and consciousness? | 2.The collection of conditions that to be jointly sufficient for an agent to be autonomous. | 2.1 What is the conception of 'autonomy'? | The term 'autonomy' be used here to denote a psychological capacity for self-government in virtue of which an individual can be credited as the author of her own thoughts and actions. | 2.2 What conditions would suffice to make the individual, like “Artemis”, autonomous? | First, she is in a position to determine her behaviour based on rational reflection. Rational reflection involves forming normative and/or evaluative judgements that can guide behaviour. Second, an autonomous individual may be required to be substantively rational to the point of being at least moderately reasons-responsive. Third, autonomy is a property that does not supervene on an individual's current state of mind and instead requires the absence of certain forms of manipulation in her past. Artemis has the right kind of history. | 3.Being a welfare subject is not necessary to satisfy those conditions | 3.1 A capacity for affective states is necessary for welfare subjectivity | (1) What is the conception of 'affective state' | Affective states are a class of psychological states of which emotions are the paradigm instance. Other commonly recognized affective states include moods and valent bodily sensations, like itches and pains. Affective states are defined at least in part by their degree of positive or negative valence and their constituent level of arousal. | (2) A very wide range of theories of welfare tell us affective states are necessary for the ability to accrue welfare goods | The hedonism,happiness, desire-fulfilment theory,Value-fulfilment theories, objective list theories all support that a capacity for affective states is necessary for the ability to accrue welfare goods. | (3)The general reason why a theory of welfare ought to impose a capacity for affective experience as a necessary condition for accruing welfare goods | There is a popular idea that what is good for someone has got to resonate with them and cannot simply leave them cold. | (4)Opposing Dorsey's denial that \"valuing\" possesses an essential affective dimension. | In Dorsey's example of Sant valuing living in a small town, Stan's belief about the prudential value for him of small-town living is simply in error. Small-town life just does not resonate with him. | Conclusion: A capacity for affective states is necessary for accruing welfare goods (and bads). | 3.2 A capacity for affective states is unnecessary for autonomy | (1)The hypothesis that autonomous agents need not have affective states ought to be acceptable in principle to actual Humeans | Humean theory of motivation might reject that the conditions sufficient to make a person autonomous do not entail a capacity for affective states: Humeans believe that any motivating reason consists of a desire and an appropriately related means-end belief. Not every kind of state we call a 'desire' can serve as a motivating reason when paired with a corresponding means-end belief. | We can render the hypothesis that some possible motivating reasons have evaluative beliefs as constituents consistent with the core of the Humean theory of motivation via the claim that it is possible for one and the same token mental state to be both a desire and an evaluative belief, and so to play the role of a desire in constituting some possible agent's motivating reason. | Conclusion: The hypothesis that autonomous agents need not have affective states ought to be acceptable in principle to actual Humeans. | (2)The hypothesis that autonomous agents need not have affective states is not incompatible with non-cognitivist and purely cognitivist views. | For non-cognitivism, normative or evaluative judgements are not robustly representational states. When it comes to giving a positive characterization of normative or evaluative judgements, it may be thought that non-cognitivists are committed to analysing them as affective states. But “non-cognitive” need not mean “affective”. | According to pure cognitivism, emotions just are normative and/or evaluative judgements. So it may be thought to follow from pure cognitivism that Artemis must be able to exhibit emotions, since emotions are nothing over and above normative or evaluative judgements of a certain kind. But pure cognitivism is not the view that all normative or evaluative judgements are emotions. | Conclusion: Philosophical positions such as the Humean theory of motivation, non-cognitivism, and pure cognitivism might lead one to reject the premise that autonomous agents need not have affective states. However, such rejections are misguided. | 3.3 The objective welfare goods cannot refute the hypothesis that a capacity for affective states is necessary for accruing welfare goods (and bads). | (1) Three putative welfare goods: nature fulfilment, knowledge and autonomy. | (2) nature fulfilment means the development and exercise of those capacities central to an individual's nature. But not every property that serves to characterize an individual's essence is a plausible candidate for the kind of property whose full development is a welfare good. | (3) knowledge. Knowledge requires belief. | (4) autonomy. Some authors who assert that autonomy is a welfare good seem to have in mind a different conception of autonomy – one involving a suitably high degree of independence of mind, for example. | Conclusion: Three putative welfare goods cannot refute the hypothesis that a capacity for affective states is necessary for accruing welfare goods (and bads). | | Conclusion: A capacity for affective states is necessary for welfare subjectivity. A capacity for affective states is unnecessary for autonomy. | | 4.Moral Standing Without Welfare Subjectivity | 4.1 The Argument from Humanity | At least some of the obligations we owe to our fellow human beings do not seem to be grounded in concern for their welfare. Instead, they seem to be grounded in respect for their autonomy and their status as separate, self-governing agents with their own lives to lead. | 4.2 The Argument from Vulcanity | Chalmers' poses about the ethics of killing Vulcans: Chalmers appeals to the possibility of Vulcans in arguing against the view that affective consciousness or sentience is necessary for moral standing. | Vulcans are autonomous beings who are not welfare subjects, the intuition that killing Vulcans is wrong suggests that welfare subjectivity is also unnecessary for someone's autonomy to merit respect. | | Conclusion: Welfare subjectivity is also unnecessary for someone's autonomy to merit respect. | | 5.The relationship between autonomy and phenomenal consciousness | 5.1 Autonomy without consciousness | The view that autonomy confers moral standing only in the presence of consciousness resembles a form of prejudice against the unconscious. | 5.2 Appealing to Reductive Theories of Consciousness | A posteriori physicalism, the view that the mental reduces without remainder to the physical based on identity statements that are not knowable a priori, may suggest a necessary connection between autonomy and phenomenal consciousness. | global workspace theories and higher order theories are most likely to vindicate this approach, but are both hardly immune to doubt. | The overall approach — namely, accepting a posteriori physicalism — is itself open to doubt. | 5.3 Linking Consciousness and Autonomy Without Reductionism | An argument that links consciousness and rationality may provide a way to link consciousness and autonomy without presupposing a reductive theory of consciousness. Multiple arguments for that claim can be made. | A bottom-up approach that directly interrogates the different sources of knowledge and their relationship to phenomenal consciousness may also link consciousness and autonomy without reductionism. | The conclusion that justified perceptual belief requires phenomenal consciousness in and of itself gets us a big part of the way to the conclusion that all autonomous agents must exhibit phenomenal consciousness. | Conclusion: There is a way of linking consciousness and autonomy that doesn't presuppose a reductive theory of consciousness. | | Conclusion: Autonomy entails phenomenal consciousness. | | 6.Conclusion | Conclusion1: Both welfare subjectivity and autonomy are able to confer moral status, and that autonomy does not entail welfare subjectivity. | Conclusion2: Autonomy entails phenomenal consciousness.2", "checklist": "1.Does the answer discuss what conditions would suffice to make the individual autonomous? | 2.Does the answer include the view that a capacity for affective states is necessary for welfare subjectivity? | 3.Does the answer include the view that a capacity for affective states is unnecessary for autonomy? | 4.Does the answer discuss the relationship between autonomy and phenomenal consciousness? | 5.Does the answer include the view that autonomy entails phenomenal consciousness?", "num_checklist": 5, "hints_background": "1. there is a debate about whether the capacity for phenomenal consciousness is necessary for having moral understanding. 2.there is a debate about whether being a welfare subject is sufficient and necessary for moral standing. 3.

First, scholars have problematized the neoliberalization of universities in the US, Europe, and elsewhere, in which the precaritization of academic work, the quantitative monitoring of research performance, and rising overwork under austerity measures are pushing researchers into impossible situations, rendering long stretches of fieldwork unfeasible. Second, anthropologists have recently begun to publish accounts of fieldwork that recognize the embodied aspects of ethnography, which often excludes many people from practicing it. Third, researchers have illuminated how caring responsibilities and family-career balance intersect with fieldwork and professional commitments. | Conclusion: Less-than-ideal labor conditions call for the patchwork ethnography. | | Conclusion: It is necessary to develop the concept of \"patchwork ethnography\" to emphasize how ethnographers carry out fieldwork while managing overlapping personal and professional responsibilities.", "checklist": "1.

Second, the specialautonomy laws do not establish local political parties. Third, the special autonomy status does not entail recognition of Papuans'fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech and assembly,or their rights to self-determination. | Special autonomy and direct local elections has shifted the locus of political strength from thecoast to the Central Highlands, where 60 percent of Indigenous Papuans live. The highland politicians are well situated to reap the benefits of thedemocratic system, thanks to their demographic and organizational advantages. | Lukas Enembe rose as one of the most emblematic models ofthe new type of Papuan leadership. The most decisive factor in his rise lies in his skillin accumulating resources and mobilizing a new ideology of Papuan power through, among other ways, pig feasts. | 2.The birth of new pig feasts | Several characteristics of the old pig feasts persist, yet their transformationis marked most explicitly by several phenomena. First, as in other Melanesian societies, the traditional pig feasts, withtheir associated sacred character, are not held as often or atthe same scale. Second, the decline of pig feasts is followed by therise of bakar batu or barapen, which translated by the author as a \"new pigfeast.\" A clear distinction is made between the two, especiallyregarding their sacred character and location within the sphere of ceremonial exchange. | 3.Pig feasts during the elections | The resurgence of pig feasts as a distinctive Papuan mode of political ordering began in 2013, when Lukas Enembe and Klemen Tinal ran with the support of a coalition of five political parties. | The regulatory framework creates a significant barrier for independent candidates and forces all candidates to run with political parties' machines instead. Because the special autonomy law has yet to pass a provision for local political parties, Papuan candidates are forced to approach national or Jakarta-based political parties and request their support. | Papuan candidates deal with this system in two ways. First, money politics. Second, during the gubernatorial elections, the candidates organize pig feasts for their voters, especially the Papuan ones. The decision to contribute pigs or cash to certain candidates is determined, for instance, by \"whether the candidates or their families havehelped paying bride wealth, fines, or compensations in thepast, or whether they helped mediate a conﬂict, that sort ofthings.\" | The campaign teams of candidate will undertake an expansive ceremonial cycle that takes place within and beyond one's related partners, and that determines one's victory. And this achievement is usually shown in the second phase of the cycle, which takes public form as the feast itself. | The organization of pig feasts is an indicator whether the candidate can mobilize constituents to his or her favor. | Conclusion: Electoral politics has become a privileged site for the reemergence of pig feasts. Conversely, through their role in electoral politics, pig feasts in West Papua have become a politically charged site of competitive exchange. Highlanders have also treated elections as a war and that pig feasts help build alliances, especially amongthe Indigenous groups. | 4.Electoral democracy in a plural political order | In the West Papuan case, both electoral politics and pig feasts operate as a procedure to mobilize power—although with different degrees of institutionalization and formalization. | Two kinds of political order: Scholars of politics have theorized political order as a stateof being. It is a quality of stability and lack of violence in a community's political life. One strand argues \"order is afunction of state capacity and their formal institutions\" . The nonstatist approach to order, on the other hand, considers community capacity and informal institutions in maintaining order. | The conception of plural political order contends that various forms of political institutionalization and values can coexist, and that liberal democracy is not the pinnacle ofpolitical order. | Political order in West Papua is a kind of plural political order. It reflects different bases of democratic politics. On the one hand, electoral politics reflects the moral and political claim of the modern nation-state and its postauthoritarian ideology. On the other hand, the pig feasts function as anonstate form of political ordering, one that draws its authority from the notion of tradition. Both are an experiment in exercising political authorities enabled by the democratic transition. | | Conclusion: Pigfeasts are used to incorporate foreign elements, either moneyor the electoral system, into the indigenous cycle of ceremonial exchange.

He doesn’t understand himself why that moral proposition is true. | Conclusion: Moral understanding is an epistemic achievement about moral matters. When you have moral understanding, you are getting things right: you represent moral reality in an accurate way. But in addition to this, you also represent that part of moral reality in a way that makes sense to you: your moral beliefs are themselves based directly in the reasons that make those beliefs true. | 1.2 Moral understanding that is shared between you and me | When you and I share moral understanding, not only do we have moral understanding in common, but the very fact of our having moral understanding in common is itself out in the open, in a shared space between you and me. We together acknowledge that we understand things the same way and in so doing we jointly commit to this way of understanding things. | The notion of a shared space: In the example, a hot day, from Charles Taylor, the sort of public space that communication makes possible is that it creates a “common vantage point from which we survey the world together”. When you and I share moral understanding, we survey moral considerations from such a common vantage point. | The basic idea is that sharing moral understanding is structurally like sharing the experience of a hot day, with two small differences. One is that understanding is itself a committal attitude. The other is that what enters a shared space between us when we share moral understanding is usually more complex. | 2.Within the central moral practices of interpersonal justification, we owe it to others to aim at sharing moral understanding with them. | one way to get at the nature of interpersonal justification is to ask ourselves what it aims at. That is, what is the constitutive aim of justifying your action to another person? | There are two complementary ways of thinking about constitutive aims. One is in terms of success conditions. If C is what it takes for some activity A to be successful, then C is the constitutive aim of A. The second way of thinking about constitutive aims is in terms of what it takes for an agent to count as performing the activity at all. | Delivery Model of interpersonal justification points that to justify your action to someone is just to give them the reasons why your action is right. | The Delivery Model runs into two major problems. First, the Delivery Model is unable to account for the fact that the duty to justify myself to you is specifically mine to carry out. Second, in the Delivery Model, it does not matter how you respond—whether you accept or reject the reasons I have provided, whether you call into question my way of describing the situation, whether you draw my attention to considerations you think I have overlooked, and so on. | Limitations of the Delivery Model: first, Delivery Model fails to account for the fact that the practice of interpersonal justification aims at a kind of uptake on the part of the addressee. Second, the Delivery Model is unable to make sense of why we engage in the practice of justifying ourselves to others, since it does not matter how you respond. | Our account of interpersonal justification, that is, should explain the personal character of the duty to justify ourselves to others, as well as the importance of the response of the agent to whom such a justification is addressed. | The constitutive aim of interpersonal justification is shared moral understanding, which can be called Shared Understanding Model. When I am justifying myself to you, what I am doing is trying to bring it about that you understand my reasons for acting as I did, and thereby why I was justified in acting as I did. On this picture, interpersonal justification overlaps with the process of making oneself understood. I put my reasons out in the open, the reasons I take to justify my action, in the hope that you will understand me as having acted reasonably, or on good grounds. In so doing, I aim for us to understand the reasons for which I acted in the same light, as reasons justifying what I did. | The Shared Understanding Model provides a unified explanation of our two desiderata. First, it can explain the observation that, when I owe you a justification for my action, that duty is specifically mine to carry out. Second, the view can also accommodate the observation that uptake matters to interpersonal justification—that whether I am successful in justifying myself to you depends on how you respond. | The Moral address view, as another alternative, points that the aim of interpersonal justification remains to deliver or provide a justification, with the caveat that this information. But it neglects the uptake at which interpersonal justification aims. | The Knowledge view, as another alternative, pointing that knowledge is the aim of interpersonal justification, avoids the problem of indifference. But it runs into a different problem: asking you to take my word for it that I was justified in acting as I did is something altogether very different from trying to justify my action to you. Knowledge can always be acquired on the basis of someone else’s authority, but trying to secure agreement by appeal to authority is antithetical to the practice of interpersonal justification. In justifying my action, I don’t appeal to my authority. I appeal to your judgment. | Conclusion: The constitutive aim of interpersonal justification is shared moral understanding. When explicating interpersonal justification, the Shared Understanding Model outperforms the Delivery Model, the Moral Address View, and the knowledge view. | 3.An apology should aim to reflect a shared moral understanding of the wrong done to its recipient. | Feeling Bad Model of apology: It says that a good apology is one that communicates that I feel (sufficiently) bad about what I did, where the nature of the bad feeling—guilt, remorse, contriteness—is whatever feeling is either constituted by or appropriate in light of the judgment that I did something wrong. | Limitations of the Feeling Bad Model: First, it makes it too easy to delegate the duty to apologize to third parties. Second, there is more to apologizing than merely expressing a sufficient amount of bad feeling. I am not off the hook when I unwittingly express feelings of remorse. | Moral address view: It suggests that the duty to apologize is a duty to respond to a | second-personal demand. It is thus a clear improvement on the Feeling Bad Model since it adequately explains the personal character of the duty to apologize. But it fails to account for the importance of the apologizee’s perspective on the wrong at issue. | Shared Understanding Condition on apology: It suggests that an apology should aim to reflect a shared moral understanding of the wrong done to its recipient. It built up from more elementary ones. First, in apologizing to you, I need to understand what I did wrong. Second, I need to understand what I did wrong in relation to you, from your perspective: I need to recognize the appropriateness of your reasons for resenting23 or otherwise objecting to what I did. Third, that very recognition of your reasons needs to be addressed to you: I need to acknowledge, to you, that your reasons for objecting to what I did are my reasons too. | The Advantages of the Shared Understanding Model: It provides a unified explanation of these two central features of apology. What explains why I must apologize myself, as well as why your perspective on the wrong matters, is one and the same fact: that an apology should try to bring about moral understanding that is shared between us. | Conclusion: When we owe an apology, what we owe is an apology that reflects a shared moral understanding of the wrong done to its recipient. | 5.Reasoning with the Unreasonable | A worry about the shared understanding: How could I be under a moral obligation even to try to bring it about that I share moral understanding with another person, when I know that my attempt to do so is all but certainly doomed to end in failure? It seems there is no duty to try to reach a shared moral understanding. | Two general observations about the view to meet the challenge: First, the duty to justify ourselves to others, or to apologize, is a directed duty: it is the logical flipside of another person’s claim or right against me that I act in a certain way. Second, The right to a justification or an apology is really a cluster of rights is to say that it includes rights to the performance of separate actions. | Conclusion: The duty to justify ourselves to others, or to apologize, is best construed as a cluster of duties, to which a cluster of claim-rights corresponds. Central among these rights is a right that those who owe us a justification or an apology try to reach a shared moral understanding with us. When a claim-holder is sufficiently unreasonable, however, they may thereby forfeit their claim that others try to reach a shared moral understanding with them, even if they retain the more minimal claim to be given a justification or offered an apology. | | Conclusion: We sometimes owe it to others to try to share moral understanding with them, the first based on the nature of interpersonal justification, the second on the norms of apology.

Second, there exist a more eirenic perspective on the relationship between these two traditions, with more reconciliatory views seeing broad agreement between liberals and socialists on many central normative values. | Key issue: What is the fundamental relationship between liberalism and socialism? | 2.Rawls's response to Marx's critique of liberal conceptions of individual rights | 2.1 Rawls's response to Marx's critique of the atomistic and egoistic conception of society implicated by the traditional liberal 'rights of man' | Rawls responded to Marx's famous argument that the 'rights of man'—Marx follows the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in speaking of rights to 'equality, liberty, security, property'—presuppose an atomistic view of human relations that is antithetical to true freedom and meaningful community. | The atomistic individualism is certainly not the view held by Rawls. For Rawls, the rights and liberties protected by his first principle of justice are not those of competitive, antagonistic and egoistic property-owners, brought warily and uneasily into social contact, but the rights of free and equal citizens who are participating in the shared project of realising and sustaining a cooperative social system. | Rawls does not treat the right to private property in productive assets as a fundamental right. Rawls's line of response to Marx here suggests that on Rawls's view any version of liberalism which ruled out a socialist system of economic organisation would by virtue of that feature show itself to be defective. | Conclusion: Rawls does not say that Marx's criticisms of the atomistic and egoistic conception of society implicated by the traditional liberal 'rights of man'are without foundation. | 2.2 Rawls's response to Marx's critique of formal nature of the 'rights of the citizen'. | In 'On the Jewish Question' Marx distinguishes the 'rights of man' from the 'rights of the citizen', understood as rights to political participation (e.g., the right to vote and hold political office). As Rawls rightly says, Marx's attitude to these two varieties of rights diverge in important ways. While Marx recognises the value of the 'rights of the citizen', he thinks that under liberalism these rights are 'merely formal' in the sense that although they are held by all citizens equally, the rights are not enjoyed by all citizens equally on account of the deep inequalities of power and wealth under which these rights are exercised. | Rawls responds not by offering a general defence of the adequacy of liberal political rights, but by pointing to a special feature of his own particular conception of justice. It is a distinctive feature of Rawls's approach to the basic liberties that he defends not only a formal set of personal and political liberties, but that he further argues for the necessity of the protection of the fair value of the political liberties (FVPL). | Conclusion: Rawls's argument that Marx's critique of formal nature of the 'rights of the citizen' does not hit home against his own version of liberalism tacitly accepts that it does strike its target with regard to many other forms of liberalism, as it condemns all those forms within which adequate protections for (something at least close to) FVPL have not been put in place. | 3.Rawls's response to Marx's critique of capitalism in terms of the problem of alienated labour | Marx's objection to liberalism is that, by defending some form of capitalism, liberals effectively allow workers to lead lives of alienated toil, depriving them of the good of self-realisation in work. | Rawls maintained an acute awareness of both the value and significance of work (as a source of meaning and a basis for citizens' self-respect) and of its possible dangers and pathologies (as when its effects can become 'narrowing and demeaning'). | Rawls's writings suggest two distinct lines of response to Marx's challenge. The first points to the way that the concern with alienation in work can be mitigated through the operation of Rawls's principles of justice, in particular FEO and the Difference Principle. The second line of response gives a reference to the discussion of the idea that what Rawls calls the Aristotelian Principle 'holds for institutional forms as well as for any other human activity'. The Aristotelian Principle is the idea that 'other things equal, human beings enjoy the exercise of their realized capacities (their innate or trained abilities), and this enjoyment increases the more the capacity is realized, or the greater its complexity.' | Conclusion: Rawls's response to the alienation objection turns not on defending liberalism or capitalism per se, but showing how only a seriously egalitarian liberal regime could successfully escape Marx's criticisms. Rawls's response to Marx is tacitly critical of existing capitalist societies, which manifestly fail to live up to the egalitarian commitments embodied in justice as fairness. | 4.Rawls's criticisms of Marx's view of justice under communism | 4.1 Rawls's criticisms of Marx's commitment to a principle of self-ownership that precludes the redistribution of income and wealth. | Rawls's criticism is that Marx would reject redistributive principles, such as FEO and the Difference Principle, that Rawls takes to be necessary for 'maintaining background justice over time'. | But Rawls's claim that a principle of self-ownership is honoured in a future communist society is mistaken. Marx's vision of the development of communism is far from a society in which self-owning workers each receive the undiluted proceeds of their labour (as Rawls's interpretation seems to suggest), but rather a society in which communism develops over time through the collective development of a range of shared institutions that cater to the needs of all citizens. | Marx argues that the Contribution Principle represents a significant improvement on distribution under capitalism, where some people who do not work get rich from the labour of others. But this does not rule out the possibility that Marx might find the Difference Principle acceptable for the lower phase of communism. | Conclusion:if we limit ourselves to the somewhat non-ideal circumstances of the lower phase of communism, where moderate scarcity and a capitalist mentality prevail, Marx and Rawls's views about justice are not that far apart. | 4.2 Rawls's criticisms of Marx's commitment to a 'technological fix' that creates limitless abundance and so transcends the circumstances of justice. | On Rawls's reading, Marx's account of the higher phase of communism is a society 'beyond justice in the sense that the circumstances that give rise to the problem of distributive justice are surpassed'. | Rawls suggests that, even if under the imagined future conditions of communist superabundance, the 'evanescence of justice' should then be seen not as a pure state of liberation, but as a regrettable loss of something of great value. | However, it is likely that Rawls and Cohen misunderstand the ways in which Marx sees communist society as moving beyond 'the narrow horizon of bourgeois right' as Marx puts it in 'The Critique of the Gotha Programme', understanding this in excessively technological terms. | The transformation that Marx looked for under the higher phase of communism relied to a greater extent than Rawls appreciated on a transformation of the soul rather than a transformation of the conditions of production. Rawls and Marx would be at one in thinking that a central element of a good society is a commitment to the needs of one's fellows. | Conclusion: Rawls's deep philosophical antipathy to countenancing the evanescence of justice therefore should not have led him here to accentuate his differences from Marx; on the contrary, their views are closer together here than Rawls imagined. | | Conclusion: Marx's critique of capitalism can be endorsed by Rawls, and Rawls's own highly egalitarian liberalism plausibly evades most Marxian worries about liberal political positions. In parallel to how things stand between Rawls and Marx, so too things stand with egalitarian liberalism and socialism: neither deeply opposed nor seamlessly reconciled, but two sibling political traditions that share more than they realise, not least their shared tendency to overestimate their distance from one another.", "checklist": "1.

Adorno?", "golden_truth": "1.Elements of ideological flaws and the Marxist affinities with radical realism | Realists focus on practices of self-justification; that is, moments in which might makes right. When a regime resorts to overt coercion to bend the will of its subjects, ideologies have not fulfilled their function – their power lies in being a covert kind of influence, difficult to see. | The most radical members see good reasons to find ideal theories of justice ideologically suspicious. Their scepticism rooted, at least to some extent, in the being/consciousness doctrine of historical materialism. | Conclusion: Realists draw inspiration from Marx and critical theory, which is why they tend to endorse, roughly speaking, a conception of ideologically distorted beliefs, attitudes and desires as shaped and formed by powerful interests within contexts of inequality. | 2.Strategies for debunking ideologies without appealing to moral norms | Radical realists should be keen to avoid what Williams described as a 'vulgar Marxism' that rejects all moral ideas as unworldly prejudices. | Radical realists should want to say something more moderate, namely that moral theories that abstract from political facts risk being prejudice-ridden. | Feasibility can be fetishised, as radical realists could argue by drawing on Adorno. Conceptions of usefulness and comprehensibility will bear the stamp of the powers that be and might thus be delusional themselves, especially since we tend to have a poor grasp of when it is really impossible to do things differently. | For radical realists, critique of such ideological claims about necessity and nature can be powerful. It historicises concepts and ideas that claim to be universal. | Conclusion: It's a powerful strategy to criticize such ideological claims about necessity and nature. | 3.Doubts as to whether a critique of ideologies should elide moral reflection | An evident way to debunk legitimation stories without resorting to moral principles is to show that they contradict empirical facts. radical realists wish to reject the epistemic warrant of beliefs in light of the reasons to mistrust the circumstances under which they arose. They rely upon an epistemological theory of reliable verification: A belief is epistemically suspect if it depends on premises that originate from the same source by which it is supposed to be justified. | A particularly promising form of critique assesses the function of beliefs, appeals to concepts and institutions that justify and sustain a political and economic order. | In such cases, however, it becomes difficult to grasp in what sense critique can or should remain outside of the moral realm to address the cui bono question: Who benefits from certain beliefs being firmly held, and what are the implications of exposing this? | Critical Theory Test by Williams: The critical question is counterfactual: If the disadvantaged were to come to know 'properly' why they really hold a belief, 'would they give it up?'One begins with particular convictions and imagines reflective questions the disadvantaged might pose. A person following these reflective steps would realise they are in a precarious position to judge whether their trust in the official stories is justified. And practical consequences follow from such a process of enlightenment. | Conclusion: There are multiple ways in which schemes of political self-justification can be evaluated without rooting criticism in a moral normativity. | 4.Limits of ideology critique of radical realists | Realists claim they can achieve similar objectives as morality-based ideological critiques without the 'risks and complications introduced by moral premises'. But avoiding moral premises entails risks and complications of its own. It can give rise to an undialectical mode of thinking that dreams of closing off entire realms of reflection while maintaining a posture of value neutrality. | Raise three challenges to radical realists via Adorno: First, Realists do not say that the relativity of judgments to constellations of power is problematic in a moral sense. But mere mistrust of the content of beliefs and the purposes of practices, given that they are a product of motivated reasoning is not enough to discredit them. Second, Realists, given their desire for moral abstinence, might fail to account for the normative presuppositions that explain their critical attitude towards the effects of power. Third, knowledge about the true origin of beliefs as well as the pliable nature of the order of things is not only difficult to gain and appreciate; it would also not suffice to liberate us from illusions since ideologies serve multifarious deep-seated needs and desires. There is reason to question the explanatory power of the radical realist ideology critique and the extent to which it can serve as an 'instrument for agents'. | Revisiting Adorno's reflections on the elements of fascist propaganda: The function of fascist propaganda is a kind of wish-fulfillment or gratification. This distortive communication is amplified by forms of moralisation that organise the world along simple dichotomies of black and white, good and evil. Radical realists will have difficulty comprehensively criticising this kind of abuse, because it requires reflection on those moments of inversion in which the cruel comes to be seen as just, and anti-democratic wishes are cloaked as democratic. | Conclusion: The ideology critique of radical realists, which bypasses morality, has notable limitations. | 5. Ideology critique should reclaim moral concepts from their distortions | Moral anti-moralism: it holds that illusions of individual responsibility and equality of opportunity hide the oppressive and alienating aspects of capitalism, which allows misery to persist amid overflowing richness. | Adorno found talk of responsibility ideologically suspicious. It distracts from how individuals are constituted and constrained by market pressures and social coercion, hiding the fact that most kinds of economic difference arise from factors beyond their control. | Adorno's ideology critique is driven by the moral belief that all senseless suffering should be abolished, grounded in an empirical observation that should make us not feel at home in this world: The forces of production and our technological capabilities are developed to such an extent that it is materially possible that no one would have to go hungry anymore or be homeless. Still, millions live in misery, which creates a strong apologetic necessity to justify suffering that could be prevented. | Realists would be right to ask for justifications for the reflective standing of those able to discern abuses of moral concepts and lend a voice to suffering. Yet they would also have to concede the limits of their approach and acknowledge that there are kinds of radical criticism that only an experience-led, moral Ideologiekritik can make, even if that introduces complications. | Conclusion: Only on the basis of a moral anti-moralism can we detect how ideological distortions turn ideas of the good and just into a 'cover of evil'. | | Conclusion: Bringing early critical theory into a long-overdue conversation with the realist movement in political philosophy is productive. Unlike radical realists, however, Adorno thought that a crucial task of critical theory is to reveal how concepts such as freedom, responsibility and democracy can become apologetic instruments for the unacceptable. The latter requires a dialectical critique that rescues morality from moralism, which disguises the cruel as just and diverts our attention away from the real causes of suffering and pain.", "checklist": "1.

Now, grooms show their worth by 'splashing money', even if they can only temporarily rent the vehicles, stereo systems, and refrigerators they present as the wedding prestation. | Setting an official 'price' for marriage payments allowed missionaries and state officials seeking to settle legal disputes or convert followers to determine who was married to whom, and when the marriage began. More recently, Ugandan government officials have tried to regulate wedding expenditures by setting the nominal 'price' of a marriage exchange. | Conclusion: Ugandan's contemporary weddings are becoming increasingly luxurious. | 3.Reality television and the wedding industry boom | The 'lavish' commercialization of weddings Ugandans complained of in the 2010s is tied to the explosive growth of the country's wedding industry. The wedding industry boomed following economic liberalization, and its continued growth is fuelled by pop-cultural media, which serves both as a key authority on wedding trends and a key source of blame for their growing opulence. | Properly documenting one's wedding is one of the event's most significant costs. Tailored specifically for each couple, the production and public circulation of wedding media reflect both conventions and reimaginations of love, romance, and the material conditions of marriage. Couples have also been paying to have their ceremonies professionally filmed and televised since the mid-2000s on shows such as Okwanjula n'embaga (Introduction and wedding) and My perfect wedding. | As those wedded and waiting to wed surmise, as images of extravagant wedding spending circulate on reality television, so too do the costs of weddings increase, creating a seeming spiral of increasing demand for ever more sumptuous weddings. | Conclusion: Reality television and the booming wedding industry have increased wedding expenses. | 4.Women making marriage payments | Women raise money for weddings in several ways: through their social networks, through their parents' social networks, and from their own salaries. In each instance, women must mobilize culturally resonant forms of respectable femininity to garner financial contributions to their weddings. | Wedding fundraising typically takes place through a series of 'wedding meetings' held by the bride's family, the groom's family, and the couple themselves. That future brides and grooms hold wedding meetings together demonstrates women's key role in raising funds and couples' ability to work together as a team, to save money, and to marshal social capital into material support. | Young women also draw on their parents' social networks to raise money. In central Uganda, raising money from family friends requires young Baganda women to demonstrate they are 'well behaved', meaning raised or 'groomed'to show respect to their elders. | Some women pay the costs of their ceremonies outright, effectively sponsoring their grooms, but the practice is only discussed obliquely, in whispers, and about other people. | Women explained that paying your own brideprice to materialize a groom's masculinity was, in fact, how a bride demonstrated her value – her 'price', in a way. | Conclusion: By 2015 women paying their own brideprice was a public secret, it unsettle provider masculinity's central tenet: that men provide the money. | 5.Entrepreneurial men and wedding work | To make one's wedding extravagant, one hires top-rated wedding vendors, many of whom are university-educated young men otherwise excluded from Uganda's dismal labour economy and thus peers of the brides who employ them. | Educated young women appear to have far more access to expendable resources in the form of salaries, both than in the past and when compared with their male peers. In a context of widespread unemployment, the wedding industry provides educated men with opportunities to start businesses and earn incomes. | Beyond wages, wedding industry jobs facilitate a sense of entrepreneurial self-actualization, what Shipley calls an 'embodied poetics for business success'. As an industry, weddings provide space and time for men to cultivate aspirational fantasies towards what many consider the future for economic growth in Uganda: entrepreneurialism. | Wedding work helps men perform and feel the potential to become economically successful – and in some instances this self-fashioning also allows them to provide for their families. | Conclusion: Women who pay their own brideprice also help actualize provider masculinity among other men. | 6.Reimagining provider masculinity | That weddings generate discursive space for reflection on changing gendered norms. educated young men and women in Kampala are well aware of how concepts such as 'culture' and 'tradition' get deployed in these public debates, and the way they describe their relationship to gendered economic traditions involving brideprice ceremonies indicates these traditions are changing all the same. | Conclusion: Wedding rituals and the broader conversations they inspire provide time and space for challenging, satirizing, and tolerating transformations in the relationship between gender, money, and marriage. | | Conclusion: In Uganda, opulent weddings requiring women to help pay their own brideprice. While doing so, women are also maintaining partner's masculinity which presents economic and emotional burdens for women.

{"task_id": 9, "domain": "philosophy", "title": "The platformization of the public sphere and its challenge to democracy", "query": "How does the market entry of platforms influence the public sphere, and how can this impact be addressed？", "golden_truth": "1. Demands on and functions of the public sphere as a societal mediation system | The conception of public sphere: The term public sphere describes (a) the social sphere where people exchange their opinions, discuss, and deliberate on public topics and (b) the process of public deliberation which leads to the formation of a public opinion. It is an important prerequisite of democracies as it enables people to observe the opinion building on political and societal topics, and therefore allows an introspective view on society. The public sphere is to be understood as a system of social mediation – an important function in today's democracies. | Theories of the public sphere can be assigned to three different paradigms. First, in the liberal paradigm, the public sphere serves as a representative sounding board for all issues and opinions on political topics. Second, in the deliberative paradigm, the power of the better argument is considered essential. The goal is to find a rationally based social consensus. Third, the participatory paradigm demands that everyone should be involved in public decision-making processes and all opinions should be considered. Everyone should be able to take part and have access without discrimination. | The functions of public sphere: It integrates different topics and opinions, legitimizes political decisions by informing citizens about facts and debates (transparency) and thus provides a prerequisite for participation. In addition, it enables public deliberation and participation in discussions. With these capacities, the public sphere contributes significantly to social orientation. | 2. Traditional media's services to society | Traditional media, which have institutionalized journalism, play an essential role in societal mediation processes: they disseminate information, ensure public communication, and still play a key role in the creation of public spheres. They are regarded as a key player for vital (mediatized) public spheres and the tenor of their reporting (= published opinion) is equated to public opinion. | However, criticism of the media and journalism has increased during the past years: Journalistic media are defamed as Lügenpresse. Journalists are accused of a biased selectivity. Economization and an increasing media concentration have had consequences for spatial and social diversity in the media, too. Therefore, trust in media fluctuates. | Journalism has fulfilled the demands of both the liberal and the deliberative paradigms with its selection and presentation of news. But these achievements are not sufficient regarding the participatory paradigm as this paradigm postulates a broader access to public communication in order to involve as many people as possible in decision-making processes. In contrast, social media offer easily accessible alternative channels to discuss all topics publicly. | 2.1 The significance of mass media for public communication in a changing society | Mass media are among society's intermediaries, as are political parties, associations, trade unions and social clubs. Historically, media were linked to the intermediaries: parties, trade unions or churches each had their own media to reach their members but also a general public. Traditional media such as the press, radio and television were the most important intermediaries – until the establishment of the internet and communication platforms. | Nowadays, new political interest groups bypass traditional media by using social media because they are able to gain access to the public sphere without the obstacles journalism has posed before. | 2.2 The structure of journalism and its contribution to society | Journalistic programs of media organizations are determined by the owners of newspapers or the socially relevant groups in the case of public broadcasters. Together they form the journalistic supply structure and formats. Over time, there has been a shift from a journalism which focused on individual political interests, where journalists oftentimes were also members of parliament, towards an understanding of journalism as a 'non-biased' service. | Driven by the success of platforms, traditional media offer more content on various different channels, which was only possible through an increase in content production. Journalistic workplaces which were formerly a place of political debate, are increasingly transforming into coordination centres for procurement, control of production, and distribution of content. The automatization of these processes which is based on algorithms supersedes former journalistic activities. Commercial pressures gain importance. | The demands on journalism have increased significantly in this process. Corresponding models are being discussed for functions of journalism: for example, 'participatory journalism', 'data journalism', and 'civic or citizen journalism'. | | Conclusion: A whole sector as well as a profession of journalism are in a state of upheaval, in a fundamental transformation process – outcome unknown. It is no longer enough to select issues and to publish articles or features with a strong emphasis on elites' and experts' opinions. Journalism must cope with new expectations. | | 3. The consequences of platformization | 3.1 Media and journalism's adaption to platform logic | Digital platforms are new intermediaries: Digital platforms are new intermediaries that constitute, coordinate and control markets by offering a wide variety of services such as the exchange of goods, the provision and exchange of information, and the facilitation of communication, in public and in private. They do not provide information services themselves but enable others to place information on the platform and communicate with each other. | Digital platforms with their new business models where users benefit from 'free' access by paying for the services with their data, have a major impact on traditiona media. Now users can access information for free which makes news consumption on the internet attractive. And because there is an increasing amount of information available free of charge, people are less willing to pay for traditional news media. Advertisers are able to target their customers more efficiently via platforms. These processes have led to a funding crisis for journalism. | Platforms are changing the norms and rules of journalism. Media and journalism had | to adapt to the multiple new distribution channels all of which have their own logic. Traditional media have become 'platform complements'. | 3.2 Increasing tabloidization and emotionalization throughout the public sphere | The new forms of provision, distribution and use of journalistic content have a variety of effects on how traditional media outlets produce content. In traditional media, content's relevance was determined by its social or political scope. That has changed. Relevance on social media is related to clicks, views, likes and shares. The orientation towards an attention-seeking economy is increasing. Content is adapted accordingly. Ever more topics need to be covered and distributed. Successful social media posts trigger attention and excitement. Traditional media, now seeking success on platforms imitate this kind of content. The social media logic is rubbing off on journalism: journalistic news contributions have been found to be increasingly emotionalized and personalized. | 3.3 Audience fragmentation and news avoidance | Traditional media are losing their audience. In the 2020 Reuters Institute's survey, among 18 to 24 year olds only 16% accessed traditional media via their own channels, the most common gateway to news was social media. | Another more recent development, which is worse, is the fact that people choose to ration or limit their exposure to news. | | Conclusion: Platforms are new institutions in the intermediary system. With the increasing dominance of platforms for public communication, they establish new norms and rules in the intermediary system. Platforms have a different business model than traditional media, but their market entry has structural and procedural effects on traditional media, journalism, and the public sphere. | | 4. The transformation of the intermediary system | Political journalism is losing resources as well as relevance. The financial crisis of traditional media has negative effects on the profession and the profession's performance. | Platforms influence the way users select information. It remains to be seen whether journalism as a service will survive in other organizational contexts than publishing houses or with other financing models than by subscriptions or donations. | The decontextualization of content, topics, and issues, in addition to the change of how people use media services could trigger social problems: The highly individualized media repertoires might lead to separate user communities, even sub-publics. | 5.Concluding remarks on the current debate and legal regulation | The influence of platforms on the intermediary system needs to be discussed from the perspective of public sphere and democracy theories. Because of platforms, the public sphere is becoming more diverse in terms of space and time. More people gain access, and more topics are being discussed. The universal access changes the constitution of the public sphere, it is getting more dynamic. However, due to these dynamics, the vast number of participants, the diversity of perspectives, views and interpretations as well as instant reactions, the aggregation of the underlying communication towards a public opinion is difficult. The public sphere loses its power to stabilize society and to integrate and it is becoming increasingly difficult to transform deliberative processes into political ones. | | Conclusion: The market entry of platforms has had structural as well as procedural consequences for the public sphere and political communication: Platforms have facilitated the access to the public sphere (input) and have also partially democratized it. However, processing topics (throughput) has become unclear and messy due to the sheer volume of topics which are now discussed in public simultaneously, and aggregation has become demanding as there are no institutionalized actors taking care of the process. The institutionalization process of platforms requires new policies. A fundamental debate about the future constitution of society as well as the development of a 'new public media system' needs to be held.", "checklist": "1.

{"task_id": 10, "domain": "philosophy", "title": "Anthropology, Development, and Beyond | For More Conversations with Economists and Other Scholars", "query": "What is the relationship between anthropology and economy in the field of development studies and what it should be in face of the grave problems today?", "golden_truth": "1.The field of development studies exemplifies the changes of economic anthropology and the relationship between economy and anthropology | In a special issue about the relations between anthropology and economics, it is mandatory to mention economic anthropology as a disciplinary niche that has represented anthropologists' visions on economic issues. | From the 1960s to the mid-1980s, Marxism as an influential theory and a common ground facilitated crossfertilizations among anthropologists, economists, historians, and geographers. | As Marxism has declined after the end of the Cold War, many of the issues discussed by economic anthropologists slowly retreated to the back of practitioners' minds or became a part of research areas identified by distinct labels and engagements with topics such as development, globalization, infrastructure, financialization, climate change, and the Anthropocene. | It is possible to find subjects dear to economic anthropology in different areas of contemporary research, but this does not mean that it currently exists in a rebranded fashion. First, economic anthropology has kept its own heuristic space. Second, the insertion in a new field of inquiry calls for new research, interlocutions, recalibrations, or creations of concepts and interpretations, and it generates genuine and original knowledge and theories. | The field of development studies allows to refer to scholarly, professional, and political relations and subjects of common interest of economists and anthropologists. | Conclusion: The field of development studies exemplifies the changes of economic anthropology and the relationship between economy and anthropology. | 2.Review the involvement of anthropologists in development since the 1940s. | Since the 1940s, development has been a discourse specialized on issues of global wealth or poverty and inequalities and on defining models and actions to solve the problems of so-called underdeveloped countries, developing countries, or emerging | economies. Economists' prominence is especially visible in places such as the World Bank (WB), the global governance institution once thought to be the mecca of development, and where they also have interacted with development anthropologists who entered this scenario as specialists on local, \"backward,\" \"exotic,\" \"poor,\" and \"Third World\" peoples. | The involvement of anthropologists in development may be subdivided into two trends: development anthropology and the anthropology of development. Development anthropology is mainly concerned with the impacts of development on local people. The anthropology of development is mostly dedicated to a critique of \"development\" as a Western discourse. The study of what was called \"development projects\" and development agencies or agents is included in this last area of anthropological concerns. | In the 1970s the academic production on development started to blossom. By studying the impact of development projects based on comparisons of different local responses, anthropologists tried to find constant structures that would allow them to predict individual and group behavior in a vein similar to economists, whose professional practices often involve risk analysis and how to avoid contingencies. At the same time, anthropologists became hire options for multilateral and national bureaucracies and civil society agencies related to the development industry. But Whether or not the practice of \"development anthropologists\" had positive effects on the institutions they have worked for and on the lives of local populations is a hot issue among anthropologists that resonates with debates related to the applied or academic divide in the discipline. | In the 1990s, there is a postdevelopment critique. According to Escobar (2005), the main point of the postdevelopment debate was not to propose another version of development but to answer the question of \"why, by means of which historical processes and with what consequences, Asia, Africa and Latin America were 'thought' as the 'Third World' by development discourses and practices\" . One important research effort within the interdisciplinary and diverse field of postdevelopment was the study of development in concrete settings, its agents, agencies, and processes. | Conclusion: The roles anthropologists play in the field of development studies are changing. | 3.The Development Field in the Wider Juncture in the Late 1980s and 1990s | The 1990s was a particularly important decade for the involvement of anthropologists in global development policies, a professional environment usually hegemonized by economists. | Macro political, economic, and sociological dynamics that affected the world system by the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s: The bipolar world of the Cold War was finished, opening a period of crisis of socialist utopian discourses and projects. This gap was filled by other utopian discourses that had been gaining momentum since the 1970s and reached their climax in 1988 and 1992. The early 1990s was a propitious juncture for a series of experiments under the banner of the newly accepted global consensus: sustainable development. | The impact of sustainable development was particularly felt in the global development agencies and in the aid industry. The window was open for a greater participation of anthropologists in these processes within multilateral agencies, state organizations, and NGOs. But development is a power field in which anthropologists and economists converge and diverge. It is made up of several social, ethnic, political, technical, professional, organizational, financial, state, and private agencies and agents. | The development field has spurred the mingling of economists and anthropologists in working environments. Their relationships are dependent on the institution's hierarchy and internal politics and not on some supposed ontological superiority of one discipline over the other. Moreover, The impact of wider political, ideological, and utopian discourses on the development field cannot be underestimated and | may open avenues of cooperation and conflict between anthropologists and economists. Generally speaking, Anthropologists will usually emphasize the value of diversity, cultural relativist approaches (such as different conceptions of nature and the good life), and the empowerment of local people. Economists will usually emphasize the value of models, numbers, rational choices, and market forces as modes of solving development problems. | 4.Changes in Academia and in the World System | The high time of development anthropology and anthropology of development is behind us, some of the subjects encompassed by the development debate of the 1990s and early 2000s are currently part of other domains of academic and public interest such as the growing field of interactions and exchanges among different epistemic communities called Anthropocene. | Limits of Anthropocene: The larger discursive and institutional field in which the Anthropocene locates itself is made up by agencies and agents that are not as identifiable as those of the development field. Moreover, in certain interpretations of the Anthropocene, there is a tendency to think that subjects of complex political fields can hardly be distinguished and that the establishment of powerful collective counterhegemonic subjects is no longer possible. Such visions obliterate the mapping of the power field now in action and make it harder to establish political priorities for scholars and citizens. | The relationship between Anthropocene and sustainable development: Anthropocene as a discourse shares similarities with sustainable development. It makes up a field of contentions where different political forces may meet, oppose, or ally themselves. There are some notable differences though. Sustainable development is a utopia, whereas the Anthropocene is a dystopia. And more importantly, sustainable development, as an heir to the many meanings and adjectives associated with \"development,\" generated its own organizational and political field, institutional and otherwise, that, despite its normalization, has also been useful for the promotion of the notion and political field of the Anthropocene itself. | Issue for future: How each of these discursive fields, with their agents and agencies, may establish productive and virtuous exchanges between them and with other sets of progressive discourses capable of constructing new formulations to win the hearts and minds of the many millions of people who know there cannot be a future without environmental and social justice. | New challenges: The world system has changed since the 1990s, especially after the end of the Cold War, the development power field has also changed in the past two decades. The most notorious novelty is the role of China in international development. | 5.Anthropologists and Economists Are a Diverse Group of Professionals Facing New Interdisciplinary Challenges | \"Heterodox economists,\" who are mostly oriented by political economy or Marxist theories and not by the prevailing neoclassical economics school, are aware that historical, sociological, cultural, racial, gender, and environmental dynamics are not \"externalities\" that may be ignored. | Anthropologists and economists make up a diverse group of professionals. Their approximations and detachments are based on both disciplinary and political visions. The kinds of specific disciplinary education and worldviews embedded in economics and anthropology are not enough to explain all divergences and convergences in the relationships between these professionals. | Conclusion: Ultimately, what is at stake when economists/anthropologists discuss development is how wealth is produced and partaken and how it affects the human | and nonhuman worlds, currently, these questions come together with major challenges. it is time for anthropologists to critically and more consistently engage with notions and problems concerning humankind. And the expectation of a generalized catastrophe caused by global warming calls for the integration of diverse cultural, political, and scientific standpoints beyond the realms of economics and anthropology.", "checklist": "1.

The girth of a graph is the smallest number of edges in any of its cycles. | | If any edge (u, v) is removed from such a graph, there is no alternate u–v path of length ≤ 2k − 1, otherwise a short cycle would exist. Therefore, such a graph has no (2k − 1)-spanner other than itself, giving a matching lower bound to Theorem 1. The conjecture is confirmed for k in {1, 2, 3, 5, Ω(log n)}, but proving or refuting it for other k is an open problem. | | Theorem 3 | For all positive integers n, k, and all ε > 0, every n-node graph G has a (1 + ε)(2k − 1)-spanner H with lightness | ℓ(H | G) ≤ O(ε^(-1) · n^(1/k)). | | Currently, little is known about lower bounds for lightness. A girth conjecture graph implies a lower bound of Ω(n^(1/k)) for (2k − 1)-spanners, but this does not use edge weights. No known lower bounds leverage weighted edges, so it is conceivable that no ε-dependence is needed and that sparsity and lightness bounds match. | | The main result shows that ε-dependence in lightness bounds is indeed necessary. | | Theorem 4 (Main Result) | Let k ≥ 2 be constant and assume the girth conjecture with parameter k − 1. There exists a family of n-node weighted graphs G where, for ε := Θ(n^(−1/(2k−1))), any spanner H with stretch (1 + ε)(2k − 1) has | ℓ(H | G) ≥ Ω(ε^(−1/k) · n^(1/k)). | | Thus, ε-dependence is necessary in general. This lower bound also extends to mildly super-constant k with extra technical work. | | Corollary 5 | For any n and constant k ≥ 2, assuming the girth conjecture with parameter k − 1, there exists an n-node weighted graph G where any (2k − 1)-spanner H has | ℓ(H | G) ≥ Ω(n^(k / (1 + k(2k − 1)))). | | ⸻ | | Relationship to the Weighted Girth Conjecture | | Definition 3 (Weighted Girth) | For a cycle C in a weighted graph G = (V, E, w), its normalized weight is | w*(C) := w(C) / max_{e∈C} w(e). | | The weighted girth of G is the minimum w*(C) over all cycles C in G. | | Theorem 6 | For all t ≥ 1, every graph has a t-spanner with weighted girth > t + 1. Moreover, any graph with weighted girth > t + 1 has no nontrivial t-spanner. | | Thus, the question of lightness for t-spanners is equivalent to the maximum possible lightness over all graphs of weighted girth > t + 1. This reframing is used in our lower bound construction: we aim to construct a graph H with weighted girth > (1 + ε)·2k and | ℓ(H) ≥ Ω(ε^(−1/k) · n^(1/k)). | | Conjecture 7 (Weighted Girth Conjecture) | For all n, g, there exists an unweighted n-node graph that maximizes lightness among all graphs with weighted girth exactly g. | | Our new lower bound does not refute this conjecture but does refute certain stronger variants, which may guide future attacks on the problem. | | Corollary 8 (Refutation of “Strong” Weighted Girth Conjectures) | The conjecture is false if we instead consider maximum lightness over graphs with weighted girth strictly larger than g, or allow g to be non-integral. | | Example: For g = 4, the densest unweighted girth-4 graph has Θ(n^2) edges, while girth > 4 graphs have Θ(n^(3/2)) edges. Our lower bound gives graphs with weighted girth > 4 and lightness Θ(n^(2/3)), exceeding the latter bound but not the former. This pattern holds for any even g ≥ 4. | | ⸻ | | Limitations to Further Progress | | The ε-dependence in our lower bound is far from the current upper bound’s dependence. Improving it for all ε or matching the upper bound’s ε-dependence is difficult because our bound relies on the girth conjecture with parameter k − 1.

In the context of streaming, exact counting of the frequency of each element may require substantial storage space, making the study of approximate counting problems of great significance. Approximate counting problems allow the algorithm to output an approximate frequency value as long as the error between this value and the true frequency is within a certain range. | - The k - counter approximate counting problem is a classic problem in streaming. Given an input string of length n, where each character of the string is from a character set of size k, the goal is to approximate the frequency of each character in the string, with the requirement that the error between the approximate frequency and the true frequency for each character does not exceed a given threshold. For example, when k = 2, the problem is equivalent to estimating the frequency of 1 (i.e., the Hamming weight) in a 01 - string. This kind of problem appears as a basic module in many complex algorithms, so studying its complexity is a fundamental question in theoretical computer science. | - In the streaming model, for the k - counter approximate counting problem, the best-known lower bound before was trivial, i.e., using O(klogn) bits of space to exactly count the frequency of each character.

Given a vector x ∈ Rⁿ₊ arriving as an incremental stream of positive updates (v, Δ), sample indices exactly with probability proportional to G(x(v)), for any G in the class | G(z) = c·1[z>0] + γ₀ z + ∫₀^∞ (1 − e^{−rz}) ν(dr) | (where c, γ₀ ≥ 0 and ν is a Lévy measure). This class includes z^p (p∈(0,1]), 1−e^{−τz}, and log(1+z). We also want limited memory and the ability to output k indices with or without replacement. | | Below is a clean recipe that achieves truly perfect sampling (zero error probability) with small space. | | ⸻ | | Key tool: Lévy-induced level functions | | For any G ∈ G, there exists a deterministic level function ℓ_G(a, b) such that: | • If Y ~ Exp(λ) and U ~ Uniform(0,1), then ℓ_G(Y, U) ~ Exp(G(λ)). | • ℓ_G is monotone increasing in both a and b. | | Interpretation: ℓ_G converts standard exponentials into exponentials whose rate is G(·). This is the engine behind exact sampling. | | ⸻ | | One-sample, O(1) state: Generic G-Sampler | | Maintain just a pair (v*, h*), initialized as (⊥, +∞). Use a pairwise-independent hash H : [n] → [0,1]. | | On update (v, Δ): | 1. Draw fresh Y ~ Exp(1). | 2. Compute h = ℓ_G(Y/Δ, H(v)). | 3. If h < h*, set (v*, h*) ← (v, h). | | Guarantee. At all times, P[v* = v] = G(x(v)) / G(∑_u x(u)). | Intuition: per index v, the minimum over its updates, | | h_v = min_i ℓ_G( (Y_i)/Δ_i , H(v) ) ~ Exp(G(x(v))) | | and the global min over v is an exponential race with total rate G(∑ x); the winner is sampled with exact G-weights. | | Space. Two words (plus the hash seed). | | ⸻ | | Many G’s, one pass, small space: ParetoSampler | | We can be universal over the whole class G by storing only the Pareto frontier of points | | (a_i, b_i, v_i) = (Y_i/Δ_i, H(v_i), v_i) | | ordered by (a, b). | | Update: insert (Y/Δ, H(v), v) and keep only the frontier. | Query(G): return the v attached to the frontier point that minimizes ℓ_G(a, b). | | Guarantee. For any G ∈ G, the returned v is an exact G-sample. | Space. Frontier size is O(log n) w.h.p., so space is O(log n) words after poly(n) updates. | | ⸻ | | k samples without replacement | | We need the k smallest keys among { h_v ~ Exp(G(x(v))) }. | | Streaming algorithm (heap of size k): | • For each update (v, Δ), compute h_candidate = ℓ_G(Y/Δ, H(v)) as before. | • Maintain, per index v, the current best key h_v = min of its candidates. | • Maintain a max-heap of the global k smallest distinct h_v. Replace the heap top if a new h_v beats it. | • At any time, output the heap’s k indices: this is the exact k-sample without replacement under G-weights (the order in the heap is the correct exponential-race order). | | Space. O(k) keys plus bookkeeping; in practice O(k + log n) words. | | (Why correct?) Independent exponentials with rates G(x(v)) order the indices exactly as sampling without replacement with those weights. | | ⸻ | | k samples with replacement | | Two standard exact options: | 1. Independent rounds. Repeat the one-sample algorithm k times using independent hash “salts” H₁, …, H_k (or disjoint RNG streams). Each round returns an exact G-weighted draw; duplicates can occur. | • Space: O(k) (one (v*, h*) per round) or O(k log n) if using the Pareto frontier per round. | 2. Poisson clocks (exponential races). For each v, generate an infinite sequence of i.i.d. keys { h_v^(j) ~ Exp(G(x(v))) } using independent salts; merge globally and take the first k arrivals with replacement. Streaming-wise, maintain the current k smallest among all generated keys. | • Space: O(k) keys; cost is extra randomness per additional arrival. | | Both methods give exact G-weighted sampling with replacement. | | ⸻ | | Instantiations for common G | | You get explicit ℓ_G and drop them straight into the update rules: | • p-th moments (G(z) = z^p, 0 < p ≤ 1). Use the subordinator for a stable law; this yields a closed-form ℓ_G. The special case p=1/2 gives the neat update: | | h = sqrt(2Y/Δ) · erf⁻¹(H(v)) | | (the F_{1/2} sampler). This produces exact p-weighted samples. | | • Poisson weight (G(z) = 1 − e^{−τz}): corresponds to a Poisson process; ℓ_G is a simple transform of Y/Δ and H(v). | • Logarithmic weight (G(z) = log(1+z)): corresponds to a Gamma subordinator; again ℓ_G is explicit via its CDF inversion. | | Because the class G matches Laplace exponents of non-negative Lévy processes, deriving ℓ_G is systematic: find the subordinator for G, define | ℓ_G(a, b) = inf{ t : P(X_t ≥ a) ≥ b }, or directly invert the map (Y, U) ↦ ℓ_G(Y, U) so that its output is Exp(G(·)). | | ⸻ | | Memory, updates, and guarantees | • Updates: Each stream update touches constant state: draw one exponential, one hash, one ℓ_G, and maybe a heap replace. | • Space: | • 1 sample → 2 words. | • Universal over G → O(log n) words w.h.p. (Pareto frontier). | • k without replacement → O(k) words; with replacement via independent rounds → O(k) as well. | • Correctness: All samplers are exact (no approximation, no failure prob): (ε, η, δ) = (0, 0, 0). | | ⸻ | | TL;DR (what to implement) | • Pick your G and its ℓ_G. | • For each (v, Δ): | • draw Y ~ Exp(1), compute h = ℓ_G(Y/Δ, H(v)), | • update (v*, h*) (one sample), the Pareto frontier (universal), or the top-k heap (k-sampling). | • Query at any time to return an exact G-weighted sample (or k of them).", "checklist": "1. **Correctly Define the Function Class G**  \n   Ensure that the function class G is defined as  \n   \\[\n   G(z) = c·1[z>0] + γ_0 z + \\int_0^\\infty (1 - e^{-rz}) \\, \\nu(dr),\n   \\]  \n   where c, γ₀ ≥ 0 and ν is a non-negative Lévy measure with ∫ min(r,1)ν(dr) < ∞.  \n   Verify its interpretation as the class of Laplace exponents of non-negative one-dimensional Lévy processes, and confirm that it includes examples such as \\(G(z) = z^p\\) (p ∈ (0,1]), \\(G(z) = 1 - e^{−τz}\\), and \\(G(z) = \\log(1+z)\\).  \n\n2. **Correctly Explain the Properties of Non-negative Lévy Processes**  \n   Review the definition of non-negative Lévy processes (stationary and independent increments, stochastic continuity, non-negativity) and explain how the Lévy–Khintchine theorem establishes a one-to-one correspondence between any \\(G ∈ G\\) and a subordinator process with parameters (c, γ₀, ν).  \n\n3. **Correctly Interpret the Lévy-induced Level Function ℓG**  \n   Verify the definition  \n   \\[\n   ℓ_G(a, b) = \\inf\\{t : P(X_t ≥ a) ≥ b\\},\n   \\]  \n   where \\(X_t\\) is the Lévy process associated with G.  \n   Confirm that ℓG is monotone increasing in both arguments and that applying ℓG to exponential/Uniform random variables transforms Exp(λ) into Exp(G(λ)), which is the key to perfect sampling.  \n\n4. **Correctly Describe the Function and Storage Efficiency of the General G-Sampler**  \n   State that the generic G-Sampler (Algorithm 1) maintains only a pair (v*, h*) in memory, i.e. 2 words, and guarantees that at all times \\(P[v* = v] = G(x(v))/G(x)\\).  \n\n5. **Correctly Explain the Update Process of the General G-Sampler**  \n   Detail that for each update (v, Δ), the sampler:  \n   - draws Y ~ Exp(1),  \n   - computes h = ℓG(Y/Δ, H(v)),  \n   - updates (v*, h*) if h is smaller.  \n   Verify that per-index minima h_v follow Exp(G(x(v))) and the global winner follows the exponential race with rate G(x).  \n\n6. **Correctly State the Storage Efficiency and Sampling Performance of ParetoSampler**  \n   Confirm that ParetoSampler keeps only the Pareto frontier of tuples (Y/Δ, H(v), v).

For each point z_j\\in A_t, build a sparse incidence vector to all dyadic boxes up to level h (plus one coordinate to enforce balance). | 2. Run a fast online subgaussian vector-balancing routine (e.g., Self-Balancing Walk) to color points x_j\\in\\{\\pm1\\} with: | \\left\\|\\sum_{j\\le t} x_j\\,v_j\\right\\|_2\\ \\text{is subgaussian (polylog bounds).} | 3. Keep the “−1” half as A_{t+1} (balanced split). | • Return A_T with exactly n points; estimate \\int f by the average over A_T. | | This procedure is randomized (so unbiased) yet enforces low discrepancy on all dyadic boxes with high probability. | | 3) What you get—formal error guarantees | | All expectations below are over the algorithm’s randomness. | • Unbiased: \\mathbb{E}[\\text{err}(A_T,f)] = 0. | • MC-level safety: | \\mathbb{E}[\\text{err}(A_T,f)^2] \\;\\le\\; e^{O(d)}\\ \\frac{\\sigma(f)^2}{n} | (so you don’t do worse than standard MC up to a modest e^{O(d)} factor). | • QMC-style bound (with HK): | |\\text{err}(A_T,f)| \\;\\le\\; e^{O(d)}\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{HK}}(f)}{n} w.h.p. | • Stronger, beyond HK (key win): | \\mathbb{E}[\\text{err}(A_T,f)^2] \\;\\le\\; e^{O(d)}\\ \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{SO}}(f)^2}{n^2}. | Typical error is therefore e^{O(d)}\\,\\sigma_{\\text{SO}}(f)/n, which can be much smaller than the HK/Koksma rate. | • Best-of-both-worlds (automatic adaptivity): for any decomposition f=g+h, | \\mathbb{E}[\\text{err}(A_T,f)^2]\\ \\le\\ e^{O(d)}\\bigg(\\sigma(g)^2 \\;+\\; \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{SO}}(h)^2}{n^2}\\bigg). | Taking g=f,h=0 recovers MC; taking g=0,h=f gives the \\sigma_{\\text{SO}} rate.

For example, to compute the integral of a function \\(f(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,1]\\), we generate \\(n\\) independent uniformly random samples \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) and use the sample mean \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i)\\) as an estimate of the integral. | | ### Error Analysis | The standard error of MC methods is \\(O\\left(\\frac{\\sigma(f)}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\), where \\(\\sigma(f)\\) is the standard deviation of \\(f\\). To achieve an accuracy of \\(\\epsilon\\), the required number of samples is approximately \\(n \\approx \\frac{\\sigma(f)^2}{\\epsilon^2}\\). This indicates that MC methods have a slow convergence rate but remain effective and easy to implement for high-dimensional integration problems. | | ## Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) Methods | | ### Basic Principle | QMC methods use deterministic low-discrepancy point sets instead of random samples for numerical integration. These low-discrepancy sequences, such as van der Corput, Halton, and Sobol sequences, are designed to be more evenly distributed in the integration domain, potentially leading to more accurate integral estimates. | | ### Koksma-Hlawka Inequality | The Koksma-Hlawka inequality provides the theoretical foundation for error analysis in QMC methods. It states that the error is bounded by the product of the discrepancy of the point set and the Hardy-Krause variation of the function. Specifically, the error bound can be expressed as \\(O\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{HK}}(f)}{n} \\times D^*(X)\\right)\\), where \\(\\sigma_{\\text{HK}}(f)\\) is the Hardy-Krause variation of \\(f\\) and \\(D^*(X)\\) is the star discrepancy of the point set \\(X\\). Under ideal conditions, low-discrepancy point sets have a discrepancy that grows slowly with the number of samples \\(n\\), allowing QMC methods to achieve a convergence rate of \\(O\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\\) for moderate dimensions.", "hints_definition": "## Smoothed-out Variation | The smoothed-out variation, denoted as σSO(f), is defined as: | | σSO(f)^2 := \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\|\\hat{f}(k)\\|^2 \\cdot \\sum_{j \\in [d]} \\max(1, |k_j|) | | where \\(\\hat{f}(k)\\) are the Fourier coefficients of the function \\(f\\).", "hints_methodology": "1. **Combining Classical Transference Principle in Geometric Discrepancy with Recent Algorithmic Advances in Combinatorial Discrepancy** | - Leverage the transference principle to apply low-discrepancy colorings from combinatorial discrepancy to geometric discrepancy, while maintaining subgaussian properties | | 2. **Exploiting Subgaussianity and Structural Properties** | - Combine the subgaussian properties of low-combinatorial-discrepancy colorings with the combinatorial structures from the transference principle.

Problem and model\n\n\nWe study deterministic algorithms in the cut-query model for a simple undirected graph G=(V,E), |V|=n. A cut query on S\\subseteq V returns \\mathrm{Cut}(S), the total capacity of edges crossing (S,V\\setminus S). The goal is to (i) compute a global minimum cut using subquadratic many queries; and as a key ingredient, (ii) compute an s-t maximum flow of value \\tilde O(n) using only \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) queries. (Throughout, \\tilde O(\\cdot) hides polylogarithmic factors.)  \n\nA second oracle we will simulate is the Bipartite-Independent-Set (BIS) query on (directed) residual graphs: given disjoint sets A,B, it asks whether there exists any edge from A to B. Crucially, a BIS query on an undirected graph can be simulated with 3 cut queries using\nc(A,B) = \\tfrac12(\\mathrm{Cut}(A)+\\mathrm{Cut}(B)-\\mathrm{Cut}(A\\cup B)).\nMoreover, BIS queries on the residual graph G_f of an explicit flow f can also be simulated with 3 cut queries on G by subtracting the known contribution of f. This lets us explore residual neighborhoods and BFS layers using only cut queries.  \n\nWe assume unit capacities unless noted; with integral capacities in [1,W] the bounds below scale by W.  \n\n\n\n2. Deterministic s-t max-flow in \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) cut queries\n\n\n\n2.1 Classical structure: Dinitz with blocking flows\n\n\nWork in iterations. Maintain flow f, residual graph G_f, and the layered graph G_L given by BFS levels L_0=\\{s\\},L_1,\\dots in G_f. Each iteration finds a blocking flow f’ in G_L that saturates at least one edge on every s-t path, augments f\\leftarrow f+f’, and recomputes G_f. The key invariant is that after each iteration the layered distance strictly increases:\n\\mathrm{dist}_{G_f}(s,t)\\ \\text{increases by at least 1}.\nWith integral capacities \\le W, Dinitz terminates in O(n^{2/3}W) iterations using the standard “short/long layered distance” analysis: once \\mathrm{dist}\\ge n^{2/3}, at most O(n^{2/3}W) further flow remains.  \n\n\n2.2 Implementing Dinitz with only cut queries\n\n\nTwo primitives suffice, both via BIS\\tocut simulation:\n\n BFS / layered graph: Build a BFS tree of G_f from s in \\tilde O(n) BIS queries (hence \\tilde O(n) cut queries). The idea is to recover residual neighbors by repeated BIS-guided binary search on candidate sets; total cost charges to discovered vertices.  \n \n Blocking flow search: Maintain a stack path s\\leadsto t within the layered graph, pushing a next-layer neighbor if a BIS test finds one; otherwise pop and delete that vertex from the search. Every push/pop costs \\tilde O(1). Each time the stack reaches length d’=\\mathrm{dist}_{G_f}(s,t), one unit of flow is sent and the stack drops by d’. Over the whole blocking-flow phase this costs\n \\tilde O\\big(n + d’\\cdot \\mathrm{val}(f’)\\big)\n BIS (thus cut) queries, where \\mathrm{val}(f’) is the value of the blocking flow found in that iteration.  \n \n\n\n\n2.3 Two-phase query bound\n\n\nSum the per-iteration costs over all iterations:\n\n Phase I (short distance): While d’<n^{2/3}, the total additional flow sent is at most the final max-flow value, assumed \\tilde O(nW). With at most n^{2/3} iterations and d’<n^{2/3},\n \\sum \\tilde O\\big(n + d’\\cdot \\mathrm{val}(f’)\\big)\\ \\le\\ \\tilde O(n\\cdot n^{2/3})\\ +\\ \\tilde O(n^{2/3}\\cdot nW)\\ =\\ \\tilde O(n^{5/3}W).\n \n Phase II (long distance): Once d’\\ge n^{2/3}, only O(n^{2/3}W) more flow remains, and d’\\le n. With at most n^{2/3} iterations,\n \\sum \\tilde O\\big(n + d’\\cdot \\mathrm{val}(f’)\\big)\\ \\le\\ \\tilde O(n\\cdot n^{2/3})\\ +\\ \\tilde O(n\\cdot n^{2/3}W)\\ =\\ \\tilde O(n^{5/3}W).\n \n\n\nTherefore an s-t max-flow of value \\tilde O(nW) can be computed deterministically in \\tilde O(n^{5/3}W) cut queries; in unweighted simple graphs W=1, this is \\tilde O(n^{5/3}).  \n\n\n\n3. From s-t max-flow to global min-cut in \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) queries\n\n\nThe global min-cut routine follows a thresholded framework: given parameter \\tau\\le \\delta-1, where \\delta is the minimum degree, either (a) output a cut of size \\le \\tau or (b) certify the global min-cut >\\tau, using \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) queries. Then binary search on \\tau (and the trivial \\lambda=\\delta case) produces the exact global min-cut.  \n\nTwo core subroutines are needed in the cut-query model:\n\n Minimum isolating cuts for a set of terminals R.\n \n A terminal-aware expander decomposition that preserves small cuts.\n \n\n\nA structural device makes both max-flow instances small: dominating sets are separated by every cut of size \\le \\delta-1.  \n\n\n3.1 Dominating-set separation and how to find one quickly\n\n\nLet R\\subseteq V be a dominating set. Then every cut of size \\le \\delta-1 hits both sides of R (“(\\delta-1)-separated”). Intuition: if some side contained all of R, vertices on the other side would all need at least \\delta cross edges by domination, contradicting a \\le \\delta-1 cut. This uses simplicity (no parallel edges).  \n\nMoreover, one can deterministically find a dominating set of size |R|=\\tilde O(n/\\delta) with only \\tilde O(n) cut queries:\n\n Reduction rule: While some v has degree >\\delta/2 in the current graph G’, add v to R and delete v\\cup N_{G’}(v). Each application removes \\Omega(\\delta) vertices, so this happens at most O(n/\\delta) times, and its query cost charges \\tilde O(1) to each deleted neighbor by BIS-guided neighbor recovery.\n \n Low-degree phase: When all current degrees \\le \\delta/2, consider the bipartite graph between W_1=N_G(R) and the remaining W_2=V(G’). Average degree arguments plus binary-search via cut queries find a vertex v\\in W_1 adjacent to \\Omega(|W_2|\\delta/n) many vertices of W_2; add v to R and delete its neighbors from G’. This shrinks G’ by a constant factor every O(n/\\delta) steps, giving |R|=\\tilde O(n/\\delta). Total queries remain \\tilde O(n).  \n \n\n\nThis R ensures that all flow instances used later (isolating cuts, cut-matching) have total flow \\tilde O(n) from the super-source/sink, so the \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) max-flow routine applies.  \n\n\n\n4. Minimum isolating cuts via \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) queries\n\n\nGiven terminals R and a threshold \\tau, an isolating cut for r\\in R is a minimum \\{r\\}–(R\\setminus\\{r\\}) cut; the minimum isolating cut of R is the minimum over r\\in R. The task is to either find one of size \\le \\tau or certify all isolating cuts >\\tau, with |R|=\\tilde O(n/\\tau). The algorithm adapts a bit-decomposition trick so that only \\tilde O(\\log |R|) max-flow instances are solved, each of total value \\tilde O(n).  \n\nProcedure.\n\n Encode & split: Assign each r\\in R a distinct O(\\log|R|)-bit label. For each bit position c, define a bipartition (A_c,B_c) of R by bit c. Every pair of terminals is separated in at least one bipartition.  \n \n Auxiliary graph H: For a bipartition (A,B), create H by adding super-source s_{\\text{src}} and super-sink s_{\\text{snk}}; connect s_{\\text{src}}\\to a for a\\in A and b\\to s_{\\text{snk}} for b\\in B with capacity \\tau+1. Edges of G have capacity 1. Compute an s_{\\text{src}}{\\text{–}}s_{\\text{snk}} max-flow. (To keep the graph simple and unit-capacity, replace capacity \\tau+1 by \\tau+1 parallel subdivided unit-edges; this increases n only by \\tilde O(n).)  \n \n Record restricted min-cut: Let (C_A,C_B) be the min s_{\\text{src}}{\\text{–}}s_{\\text{snk}} cut restricted back to G (remove the supers). By max-flow/min-cut, (C_A,C_B) is a min cut separating C_A\\cap A from C_B\\cap B in G.  \n \n Delete and grow components: Delete \\partial C_A (for all bit bipartitions). For each r\\in R, let T_r be the vertices now reachable from r; put into R’ those r that were never saturated in any bipartition max-flow (formally: the super-source edge into r was not saturated whenever r\\in A, and symmetrically for B). Then the sets T_r for r\\in R’ are pairwise disjoint.  \n \n Local contraction tests: For each r\\in R’, contract V\\setminus(\\{r\\}\\cup(T_r\\setminus R)) to a single sink s_r in a new graph G_r (keeping parallel edges). Compute the min (r,s_r) cut; if its size \\le\\tau, output it as an isolating cut; otherwise set \\lambda_r=\\infty. Because T_r are disjoint, the sum of the query costs over all r\\in R’ is bounded by \\sum \\tilde O(|T_r|^{5/3})\\le \\tilde O(n^{5/3}).  \n \n\n\nCorrectness. If some r^\\star has a closest isolating cut C_{r^\\star} of size \\le\\tau, then in every bipartition (A,B) that separates r^\\star from some other terminal, r^\\star is unsaturated, and C_{r^\\star}\\subseteq C_A (when r^\\star\\in A) by submodularity/closest-cut arguments. Hence C_{r^\\star}\\subseteq T_{r^\\star}, so the contracted test in G_{r^\\star} recovers a cut \\le\\tau. If no r has isolating cut \\le\\tau, the procedure certifies this.  \n\nQuery complexity. Each bipartition’s max-flow in H has total flow value \\tilde O(n) (all terminals live in R of size \\tilde O(n/\\tau), each incident capacity \\le \\tau+1); thus each is solvable in \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) cut queries. There are only O(\\log|R|)=\\tilde O(1) bipartitions, and the disjoint-sum bound over local tests yields a total of \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) queries.  \n\n\n\n5. Handling unbalanced vs. balanced small cuts\n\n\nLet R be \\tau-separated (e.g., a dominating set) and \\varphi\\in \\mathrm{poly}(1/\\log n).\n\n A cut C=(C_1,C_2) with |\\partial C|\\le \\tau is \\varphi-unbalanced for R if \\min\\{|C_1\\cap R|,|C_2\\cap R|\\}\\le (1/\\varphi)^3+1/\\varphi; otherwise it is \\varphi-balanced.  \n \n\n\n\n5.1 Unbalanced case → isolating cuts suffice\n\n\nUsing a splitter family \\mathcal{F} of size \\tilde O(1) (deterministically constructed subsets with the property that every small subset of R is “hit” exactly once), one can run the isolating-cut routine on the sets in \\mathcal{F}. If an unbalanced cut of size \\le\\tau exists, one of these calls will succeed and output a cut \\le\\tau. Total queries remain \\tilde O(n^{5/3}).  \n\n\n5.2 Balanced case → terminal-aware expander decomposition\n\n\nWhen all \\le\\tau cuts are \\varphi-balanced for R, compute a decomposition of V into parts V_1,\\dots,V_k such that each induced subgraph G[V_i] is a (\\varphi,R_i)-almost expander with a large core R’i\\subseteq R_i=R\\cap V_i, and the number of inter-part edges is bounded by\n\\sum{i\\ne j} |E(V_i,V_j)|\\ =\\ O\\big(\\varphi\\,|R|\\,(\\tau+1)\\,\\log^6 n\\big).\nThis is achieved via a cut-matching game with a strengthened matching player:\n\n In each round, the cut player bisects R (explicit, no queries).\n \n The matching player either returns a \\varphi(\\tau+1)-sparse balanced cut (then we are done), or embeds a (\\tau+1)-regular almost perfect matching between the two sides using multicommodity flow with congestion 1/\\varphi. To implement this with cut queries, add s_{\\text{src}} to one side with capacity \\tau+1 per terminal and s_{\\text{snk}} to the other; edges of G get capacity 1/\\varphi. The total flow is \\tilde O(n), so each round costs \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) queries.  \n \n\n\nAfter O(\\log n) rounds, the union of perfect b-matchings has sparsity \\Omega(\\tau+1). Some edges are fake (to complete almost matchings); expander pruning removes a tiny set P of vertices so that the remaining graph (without fake edges) has conductance \\tilde\\Omega(1). Defining R’ = (R\\setminus P) minus the few terminals with too many edges touching P or fake edges gives |R’|\\ge (1-1/\\log n)|R|. One concludes that each piece G[V_i] is a (\\varphi,R_i)-almost expander with large core R’_i. All of this holds with \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) total queries.  \n\n\n5.3 Sparsify the terminal set and recurse\n\n\nHaving the decomposition, build a smaller \\tau-separated terminal set R_e by:\n\n Adding all R_i\\setminus R’_i (few by construction),\n \n From each small part (very small core), pick one terminal from R’_i,\n \n From each large part, pick only 1+1/\\varphi terminals from R’_i.\n \n\n\nIf no part has |\\partial V_i|\\le \\tau, then |R_e|\\ \\le\\ O\\big(\\varphi |R|\\log^6 n\\big)+ |R|/\\log n, and one can show R_e remains \\tau-separated. Choosing \\varphi=1/\\log^{10} n ensures |R_e|\\le \\tfrac12 |R|. Thus, either we already found a \\le\\tau cut (a part boundary) or we halve the terminal set while preserving separability. Depth is O(\\log |R|)=\\tilde O(1), and each level costs \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) queries.  \n\n\n\n6. Threshold theorem and global min-cut\n\n\nThreshold version. For any \\tau\\le \\delta-1, there is a deterministic \\tilde O(n^{5/3})-query algorithm that either outputs a cut of size \\le\\tau or certifies the global min-cut >\\tau. This follows by:\n(i) computing a \\tilde O(n/\\delta)-size dominating set R in \\tilde O(n) queries;\n(ii) if an unbalanced \\le\\tau cut exists, finding it via isolating cuts; otherwise (iii) performing the terminal-aware expander decomposition to obtain a smaller \\tau-separated R_e and recursing; a \\le\\tau cut is found at some level or ruled out. Overall queries: \\tilde O(n^{5/3}).  \n\nGlobal min-cut. Binary search over \\tau (and handle the trivial \\lambda=\\delta case via a min-degree vertex) yields the exact global minimum cut in \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) cut queries for simple unweighted graphs—the first deterministic subquadratic bound in this model.  \n\n\n\n7. Implementation notes and scope\n\n\n Unit capacities via subdivision. Super-source/sink edges of capacity \\tau+1 are realized by \\tau+1 parallel subdivided unit edges, keeping the graph simple and only \\tilde O(n) larger. This preserves the \\tilde O(n^{5/3}) query bounds of the max-flow routine.  \n \n Why simplicity matters. The dominating-set separation lemma uses that every vertex in the “light” side of a small cut has degree \\ge \\delta with no parallel edges inflating capacity, so a \\le \\delta-1 cut cannot contain all of R on one side. Extending to weighted or non-simple graphs breaks this argument.  \n \n Weighted graphs. With integer capacities in [1,W], the s-t routine costs \\tilde O(n^{5/3}W) queries; the global-min-cut framework continues to apply where the specialized flow instances remain of value \\tilde O(nW).  \n \n\n\n\n\n8.

{"task_id": 19, "domain": "Computer Science", "title": "Improved Online Reachability Preservers", "query": "How to construct a sparse reachability preserver online to preserve the reachability of given demand pairs in a directed graph?", "golden_truth": "Develop a framework in which to analyze online reachability preservers, and we use it to prove two new upper bounds, improving on both of the results mentioned above: | | **Theorem 1 (Online Pairwise Reachability Preservers).** Given an \\( n \\)-node directed graph \\( G \\), there is an online algorithm that constructs a reachability preserver \\( H \\) of \\( |P| = p \\) total demand pairs of size at most | \\[ |E(H)| \\leq O\\left( \\frac{n^{2+\\alpha}}{3+\\alpha + o(1)} p^{\\frac{2}{3+\\alpha}} + n^{2-2\\alpha+o(1)} p^{\\alpha} + n \\right) < O\\left( n^{0.72} p^{0.56} + n^{0.6} p^{0.7} + n \\right), \\] | where \\( \\alpha \\geq 0.7 \\) is a root of \\( 4x^3 - 13x^2 + 10x - 2.1 \\). | | **Theorem 2 (Online Source-Restricted Reachability Preservers).** Given an \\( n \\)-node directed graph \\( G = (V, E) \\), and a promise that the demand pairs will satisfy \\( P \\subseteq S \\times V \\) for some set of source nodes \\( S \\subseteq V \\), there is an online algorithm that constructs a reachability preserver \\( H \\) of \\( p \\) total demand pairs of size at most | \\[ |E(H)| \\leq O\\left( (n|S|p)^{1/2} + n \\right). \\] | The same result holds under the promise that \\( P \\subseteq V \\times S \\), but requires a slightly different algorithm. | | All of our construction algorithms are deterministic, run in polynomial time, and do not require any knowledge of \\( P \\) or \\( S \\) (including their size). **Theorem 2** ties the state-of-the-art upper bound in the offline sourcewise setting [1]. | | It may also be interesting to compare **Theorem 1** to the following lower bound, proved in [8] in a stronger online model: | | **Theorem 3.** Consider a stronger version of the online model where the graph \\( G \\) is initially empty, and an adversary may add new edges to \\( G \\) in each round before providing the next demand pair. Then there is a strategy for the adversary that guarantees that any online reachability preserver \\( H \\) will have size | \\[ |E(H)| \\geq \\Omega\\left( (np)^{2/3} + n \\right). \\] | | Our bound in **Theorem 1** is polynomially better than this one (in exchange for a weaker adversary), and so it formally separates these two models. | | A couple of the new tools that we develop for the online setting also turn out to be helpful in the classical offline setting. This yields the following small polynomial improvement in the state of the art: | | **Theorem 4 (Offline Reachability Preservers).** Given an \\( n \\)-node directed graph \\( G \\) and a set of demand pairs \\( P \\), one can construct in polynomial time a reachability preserver \\( H \\) of size | \\[ |E(H)| \\leq O\\left( n^{\\frac{3}{4}} p^{\\frac{1}{2}} + n^{2 - \\sqrt{2} + o(1)} p^{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} + n \\right) \\leq O\\left( n^{0.75} p^{0.5} + n^{0.59} p^{0.71} + n \\right). \\] | | **Theorem 5 (Non-Adaptive Reachability Preservers).** There are online algorithms satisfying **Theorem 1** and **Theorem 2** where the selected path for each demand pair \\( (s, t) \\) depends only on the input graph \\( G \\), the set of source nodes \\( S \\) (for **Theorem 2**), and | - the index \\( i \\) of the current demand pair, or | - the total number \\( p \\) of demand pairs that will arrive. | | **Theorem 6 (Offline UDSN [1, 15]).** There is a randomized polynomial time algorithm for (offline) UDSN that, given an \\( n \\)-node input graph \\( G \\) and a set of \\( p \\) demand pairs \\( P \\), returns a reachability preserver \\( H \\) of size | \\[ |E(H)| \\leq \\text{OPT} \\cdot O\\left( \\min\\left\\{ n^{\\frac{4}{7} + \\varepsilon}, p^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon} \\right\\} \\right) \\] | where \\( \\text{OPT} \\) is the number of edges in the sparsest possible reachability preserver of \\( G, P \\). | | **Theorem 7 (Online UDSN, parametrized on \\( p \\) [21]).** There is a randomized polynomial time algorithm for online UDSN that achieves a competitive ratio of \\( O(p^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon}) \\). | | Thus, the remaining question is whether the dependence on \\( n \\) in **Theorem 6** can be recovered in the online setting. Here the state of the art is due to Grigorescu, Lin, and Quanrud, who obtained a competitive ratio of \\( n^{\\frac{2}{3} + \\varepsilon} \\) [24], roughly following the framework of Chlamtác et al. [16] but with adaptations for the online setting. As an application of our new online source-restricted preservers, we are able to substitute them into this framework, improving the competitive ratio: | | **Theorem 8 (Online UDSN, parametrized on \\( n \\)).** There is a randomized polynomial time algorithm for online UDSN that achieves a competitive ratio of \\( O(n^{\\frac{3}{5} + \\varepsilon}) \\). | | # Technical Preliminaries | ## The DAG reduction | While proving all of our upper bounds, it will be convenient to assume that the input graph is a DAG. That this assumption is without loss of generality comes from the following standard reduction, which we will recap somewhat briefly here: | | **Theorem 9 (DAG Reduction (folklore)).** If there is an algorithm that constructs a reachability preserver \\( H \\) of size | \\[ |E(H)| \\leq f(n, p, \\sigma) \\] | for any \\( p \\) demand pairs using \\( |S| = \\sigma \\) source (or sink) nodes in an \\( n \\)-node DAG, then there is an algorithm that constructs a reachability preserver \\( H \\) of size | \\[ |E(H)| \\leq f(n, p, \\sigma) + 2n \\] | in arbitrary graphs. | | **Proof.** Given an input graph \\( G \\), compute a strongly connected component (SCC) decomposition. For each component \\( C \\) in the decomposition, choose an arbitrary vertex \\( v \\in C \\) and an in- and out-tree rooted at \\( v \\) spanning \\( C \\). There are \\( 2(|C| - 1) \\) edges in these two trees, and hence there are slightly less than \\( 2n \\) edges in total, across all trees. | | We add all edges in these trees to our reachability preserver \\( H \\) at their first opportunity, and then for the rest of the construction we treat each SCC as a single contracted supernode, yielding a DAG \\( G' \\). For each demand pair \\( (s, t) \\), we can map the nodes \\( s, t \\) onto the corresponding supernodes in \\( G' \\) and choose paths in \\( G' \\) using our assumed DAG algorithm, to get a reachability preserver \\( H' \\) in \\( G' \\) on \\( \\leq f(n, p, \\sigma) \\) edges. Each edge \\( (u, v) \\) added to \\( H' \\) can be mapped back to any single edge in \\( G \\) between the set of nodes corresponding to the supernode \\( u \\) and the set of nodes corresponding to the supernode \\( v \\). Since our in- and out-trees preserve strong connectivity among all nodes in each of these sets, this will give a correct preserver in \\( G \\). | | ## Path System Definitions | A path system is a pair \\( S = (V, \\Pi) \\), where \\( V \\) is a set of vertices and \\( \\Pi \\) is a set of nonempty vertex sequences called paths. We will next recap some basic definitions; see also [8] for more discussion. | | Note that, even when the vertex set \\( V \\) is that of some graph \\( G \\), the paths in \\( \\Pi \\) are abstract sequences of vertices that do not necessarily correspond to paths in \\( G \\). The length of a path \\( \\pi \\in \\Pi \\), written \\( |\\pi| \\), is its number of vertices (hence off by one from the length of the path through some graph). The degree of a node \\( v \\in V \\), written \\( \\deg(v) \\), is the number of paths that contain \\( v \\) (which may differ significantly from its degree as a node in a graph). The size of \\( S \\), written \\( \\|S\\| \\), is the quantity | \\[ \\|S\\| := \\sum_{\\pi \\in \\Pi} |\\pi|. \\] | | We note that \\( k \\)-bridges still count even when they are degenerate; for example, two paths that coincide on two consecutive nodes count as a 2-bridge, and three paths that coincide on three consecutive nodes contain a 3-bridge, etc. | | A path system is **acyclic** if it does not contain any directed cycle as a subsystem, or equivalently, if there is a total ordering of the vertices \\( V \\) such that the order of vertices within each path \\( \\pi \\in \\Pi \\) agrees with this ordering. We will frequently consider **ordered path systems**, which are path systems with a total ordering on their path set \\( \\Pi \\). With this, we will sometimes only forbid subsystems with certain ordering constraints, e.g., 3-bridges where the last arc comes before the first in the ordering of \\( \\Pi \\). | | # Online Reachability Preservers | ## Path Growth Algorithms | | A key tool in our online upper bounds will be the following two (very similar) path selection algorithms. We use these algorithms to generate a path \\( \\pi(s, t) \\) for each demand pair \\( (s, t) \\) as it arrives, and then we add the edges of this path to the current preserver. Our path generation algorithms are greedy, growing paths one edge at a time and locally avoiding new edges if possible. | | ### Algorithm 1: Forwards-Growth Path Generation | ```python | Input: DAG \\( G = (V, E) \\), current preserver \\( H \\subseteq G \\), demand pair \\( (s, t) \\) | 1. Let \\( \\pi \\leftarrow (s) \\) | 2. while last node of \\( \\pi \\) is not \\( t \\) do | 3. \\( u \\leftarrow \\) last node of \\( \\pi \\) | 4. if there exists an edge \\( (u, v) \\in E(H) \\) with \\( t \\) reachable from \\( v \\) then | 5. append any such edge \\( (u, v) \\) to the back of \\( \\pi \\) | 6. else | 7. append to the back of \\( \\pi \\) any edge \\( (u, v) \\in E(G) \\) with \\( t \\) reachable from \\( v \\) | 8. return \\( \\pi \\) | ``` | | ### Algorithm 2: Backwards-Growth Path Generation | ```python | Input: DAG \\( G = (V, E) \\), current preserver \\( H \\subseteq G \\), demand pair \\( (s, t) \\) | 1. Let \\( \\pi \\leftarrow (t) \\) | 2. while first node of \\( \\pi \\) is not \\( s \\) do | 3. \\( v \\leftarrow \\) first node of \\( \\pi \\) | 4. if there exists an edge \\( (u, v) \\in E(H) \\) with \\( u \\) reachable from \\( s \\) then | 5. append any such edge \\( (u, v) \\) to the front of \\( \\pi \\) | 6. else | 7. append to the front of \\( \\pi \\) any edge of the form \\( (u, v) \\in E(G) \\) with \\( u \\) reachable from \\( s \\) | 8. return \\( \\pi \\) | ``` | | The two algorithms are symmetric to each other, and differ only in whether we grow the path from front to back or from back to front. | | As we use these algorithms to sequentially generate paths and build our preserver, it will be helpful to track an auxiliary path system \\( Z = (V, \\Pi) \\). Each time we add a path \\( \\pi(s, t) \\) to \\( H \\), say that a new edge is an edge \\( e \\in \\pi(s, t) \\) that was not previously in the preserver. We then add a corresponding path \\( \\pi' \\) to \\( Z \\), whose nodes are | \\[ \\pi' := \\begin{cases} | \\{u \\mid \\text{there is a new edge } (u, v) \\in \\pi(s, t)\\} \\cup \\{t\\} & \\text{if forwards-growth is used} \\\\ | \\{v \\mid \\text{there is a new edge } (u, v) \\in \\pi(s, t)\\} \\cup \\{s\\} & \\text{if backwards-growth is used} | \\end{cases} \\] | and in either case, these nodes are ordered in the path \\( \\pi' \\) the same as their order in \\( \\pi(s, t) \\). We will also treat \\( Z \\) as an ordered path system, with the paths in \\( Z \\) ordered by the arrival of the demand pairs that generated each path. The following properties of \\( Z \\) all follow straightforwardly from the construction: | | **Lemma 10 (Properties of \\( Z \\)).** | 1. \\( Z \\) is acyclic, | 2. \\( \\|Z\\| = |E(H)| + p \\), | 3. Under forwards-growth, \\( Z \\) has no bridge in which the first arc comes before the river in the ordering of \\( \\Pi \\). Under backwards-growth, \\( Z \\) has no bridge in which the last arc comes before the river in the ordering of \\( \\Pi \\). | | **Proof.** | 1. Since the input graph \\( G = (V, E) \\) is a DAG, the order of nodes in each path \\( \\pi \\in \\Pi \\) agrees with the topological ordering of the nodes in \\( V \\), implying that \\( Z \\) is acyclic. | 2. Initially, we have \\( \\|Z\\| = |E(H)| = 0 \\). Then, every path \\( \\pi' \\) added to \\( Z \\) corresponds to a path \\( \\pi(s, t) \\) that contributes exactly \\( |\\pi'| - 1 \\) new edges to \\( H \\), so in the end we have \\( \\|Z\\| = |E(H)| + p \\). | 3. We will prove this for forwards-growth; the argument for backwards-growth is symmetric (up to reversal of direction of the edges of the input graph \\( G \\)). Seeking contradiction, suppose there is a bridge formed by nodes \\( (x_1, \\ldots, x_k) \\), arc paths \\( \\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_{k-1} \\), and river path \\( \\pi_r \\), with \\( \\pi_1 <_\\Pi \\pi_r \\). Let \\( \\pi(s_1, t_1), \\pi(s_r, t_r) \\) be the paths generated by forwards-growth corresponding to \\( \\pi_1, \\pi_r \\) respectively. By construction, since \\( x_1 \\in (\\pi_1 \\cap \\pi_r) \\), these paths both contribute new edges to \\( H \\) leaving \\( x_1 \\); call the first one \\( (x_1, y) \\in \\pi(s_1, t_1) \\). Now notice that the arcs witness reachability among all of the node pairs | \\[ | (y, x_2) \\in \\{z \\mid z \\in \\pi_1\\}, (x_2, x_3) \\in \\{z \\mid z \\in \\pi_2\\}, \\ldots, (x_{k-1}, x_k) \\in \\{z \\mid z \\in \\pi_{k-1}\\}, (x_k, t_r) \\in \\{z \\mid z \\in \\pi_k\\}. | \\] | So by transitivity, the node pair \\( (y, t_r) \\) is reachable. When we generate \\( \\pi(s_r, t_r) \\) using forwards-growth, since we have already added \\( \\pi(s_1, t_1) \\), the edge \\( (x_1, y) \\) is already present in \\( H \\) and we have \\( (y, t_r) \\) reachability. So the algorithm will not choose to add a new edge leaving \\( x_1 \\) while generating \\( \\pi(s_r, t_r) \\), which completes the contradiction. | | | | | ## Online Source-Restricted Reachability Preservers | We will prove the following upper bound on source-restricted preservers in the online model: | | **Theorem 11.** In the online model with an \\( n \\)-node input DAG \\( G = (V, E) \\) and \\( p \\) total demand pairs, the final preserver \\( H \\) will have size | \\[ |E(H)| \\leq O\\left( (np|S|)^{1/2} + n \\right) \\] | in either of the following two settings: | - \\( S \\) is the set of start nodes used by the given demand pairs \\( P \\) (that is, \\( P \\subseteq S \\times V \\)), and the builder generates paths in each round using the backwards-growth algorithm, or | - \\( S \\) is the set of end nodes used by the given demand pairs \\( P \\) (that is, \\( P \\subseteq V \\times S \\)), and the builder generates paths in each round using the forwards-growth algorithm. | | Notably, neither the forwards- nor backwards-growth algorithm requires the builder to know the number of demand pairs \\( p \\) or any information about the set of source/sink nodes \\( S \\). We will only prove the latter point in **Theorem 11**, analyzing forwards-growth and assuming \\( P \\subseteq V \\times S \\). The other point is symmetric. | | The proof will work by analyzing the path system \\( Z \\) associated with the online path-adding process; recall its essential properties in **Lemma 10**. Let \\( \\ell := \\|Z\\| / p \\) be the average path length and let \\( d := \\|Z\\| / n \\) be the average node degree. If \\( d \\leq O(1) \\) then we have \\( \\|Z\\| \\leq O(n) \\) and the theorem holds, so we may assume in the following that \\( d \\) is at least a sufficiently large constant. | | Imagine that we add the paths from \\( Z \\) to an initially-empty system, one at a time, in the reverse of their ordering in \\( \\Pi \\). We observe: | | **Lemma 12.** There is a path \\( \\pi \\in \\Pi \\) such that when \\( \\pi \\) is added in the above process, it contains at least \\( \\ell / 4 \\) nodes of degree at least \\( d / 4 \\) each. | | **Proof.** Suppose not. Then, by counting the first \\( d / 4 \\) times each node appears in a path separately from the remaining times, the total size of \\( Z \\) can be bounded as | \\[ \\|Z\\| \\leq \\frac{nd}{4} + \\frac{p\\ell}{4} \\leq \\frac{\\|Z\\|}{4} + \\frac{\\|Z\\|}{4} = \\frac{\\|Z\\|}{2}, \\] | which is a contradiction. | | **Lemma 13.** \\( \\ell d \\leq O(|S|) \\). | | **Proof.** Suppose for contradiction that \\( \\ell d > 16|S| \\). By the previous lemma, there is a path \\( \\pi \\in \\Pi \\) that intersects at least \\( \\ell d / 16 > |S| \\) other paths in \\( \\Pi \\), which were added to the system before \\( \\pi \\) (and hence come later than \\( \\pi \\) in the ordering of \\( \\Pi \\)). By the Pigeonhole principle, and since the demand pairs satisfy \\( P \\subseteq V \\times S \\), at least two of these intersecting paths \\( q_1, q_2 \\) end at the same node \\( t \\in S \\). Since by **Lemma 10** \\( Z \\) does not contain any 2-bridges, \\( q_1, q_2 \\) may not intersect at any other nodes, and so they intersect \\( \\pi \\) at two different nodes. But this implies that \\( \\pi, q_1, q_2 \\) form a 3-bridge in which \\( \\pi \\) is the first arc and it precedes both \\( q_1, q_2 \\) in the ordering of \\( \\Pi \\) (see Figure 2). This contradicts **Lemma 10**, completing the proof. | | We now complete the proof by algebraically rearranging the inequality from the previous lemma. We have: | \\[ \\ell d \\leq O(|S|) \\] | \\[ (p\\ell)(nd) \\leq O(|S|pn) \\] | \\[ \\|Z\\|^2 \\leq O(|S|pn) \\] | \\[ \\|Z\\| \\leq O((|S|pn)^{1/2}) \\] | | Since by **Lemma 10** we have \\( \\|Z\\| \\geq |E(H)| \\), this implies our desired bound on the size of the output preserver. | ## Online Pairwise Reachability Preservers | | By following an identical proof strategy to our upper bound in the source-restricted setting (i.e., exploiting forbidden ordered 2- and 3-bridges), it is possible to prove an upper bound of |E(H)| ≤ O((np)^(2/3) + n) (details omitted, since we will show a stronger bound than this). As discussed in [8], this is probably the best upper bound one can show by exploiting only the forbidden ordered 2- and 3-bridges from Lemma 10. Nonetheless, we will show a stronger bound, which crucially also exploits the forbidden ordered 4-bridges from Lemma 10. | | Recap of [8]. Recent work of Bodwin, Hoppenworth, and Trabelsi [8] on offline reachability preservers introduced a framework for extremal analysis of forbidden 4-bridges, which we will briefly recap here. First: | **Lemma 14 (Independence Lemma, c.f. [8], Lemma 38).** Let β(n, p, ∞) denote the maximum possible size of a path system with n nodes, p paths, and no bridges as subsystems. Then every n-node directed graph and set of p demand pairs has an offline reachability preserver H of size |E(H)| ≤ O(β(n, p, ∞)), and this is asymptotically tight. | | Thus, it suffices to argue about the extremal size of a bridge-free path system. We remark here that versions of this lemma are perhaps implicit at a low level in prior work. It is also an inherently offline lemma, and breaks down completely in the online setting; the reliance on this lemma (or its underlying ideas) is essentially why the known results for offline reachability preservers do not tend to extend to the online setting. | | This previous paper then argues as follows. Assume for convenience that all paths have length Θ(ℓ) and all nodes have degree Θ(d), for some parameters ℓ, d. Recall that the upper bound from forbidden 2- and 3-bridges is O((np)^(2/3) + n), and so our goal is to show that this bound cannot be tight. A few straightforward calculations reveal that, if this bound were tight, then for the typical pair of paths π1, π2 in the system there will be Θ(ℓ) paths that intersect π1 and then π2. However, no pair of these intersecting paths may have crossing intersection points with π1, π2. | | If there are Θ(ℓ) paths that intersect both π1, π2, and yet these intersecting paths cannot cross each other, then the typical intersecting path must “lie flat” in the sense that there is not much of a gap along either π1 or π2 to, say, the h nearest intersecting paths (for some parameter h). In order to exploit this, the key strategy in [8] is to sample a random base path πb ∈ Π, and then analyze the random subsystem S′ on the vertex set formed by examining the h adjacent nodes along the paths that intersect πb. | | Since πb extends along its branching paths, we should expect S′ to contain many long paths. But we can apply known upper bounds to S′ to rule out this possibility. This implies that, in fact, the typical pair of paths π1, π2 have ≪ ℓ paths that intersect both, leading to an improved upper bound. | | Our Offline Improvements. An auxiliary result of this paper is an improvement in the bound shown by [8]. We refer back to Theorem 4 for the statement, or Appendix B for the proof. The source of these improvements is from an improved strategy for controlling the size of the random subsystem S′. One of the two ways in which this part improved is by recursively bounding the size of S′ (this is executed in Lemma 40). Although this idea is conceptually straightforward, it requires a significant refactoring of the proof to enable it. The technical reason is that [8] bounds the input system Z using an ℓ1 norm of path lengths (the standard notion of size) but S′ using an ℓ2 norm of path lengths, making it impossible to directly apply the bound on Z recursively to S′. We switch to bounding both using the ℓ2 norm everywhere, and we only move back to our desired ℓ1 norm at the very end of the proof. The other new ingredient is an improved counting of the contribution of “short” paths to the size of S′, which is executed in Lemma 40. | | Our Online Adaptation. It will be slightly more convenient in this exposition to consider the backwards-growth strategy for path generation here, although of course by symmetry either strategy works (we use this convention in Appendix A as well). We will analyze the path system Z constructed above, and in particular Lemma 10 states that bridges are forbidden in Z whose last arc comes before the river. | | Can we exploit forbidden ordered 4-bridges by following the strategy outlined above? Some parts of the method extend easily, with minor tweaks. For example, instead of counting any paths π that intersect the typical pair of paths π1, π2, we can restrict attention to those that also come after π1, π2 in the ordering. Then the “crossing” in Figure 3 is still forbidden (since the river π3 is assumed to come after the last arc π2). Relatedly, when we define S′, we need to consider only the paths that intersect πb and come before it. Nonetheless, all these definitional adaptations turn out to affect the relevant counting arguments by only constant factors, and so they do not harm the argument. There are many other minor issues that we will not overview, which can be dispatched with a little technical effort. | | However, there is one major problem: there is now potential for overlap in the paths that branch off πb. That is, in the offline setting, we can exploit 3-bridge-freeness to argue that no two paths that branch off πb also intersect each other, and thus every node in S′ (except those on πb itself) is in exactly one branching path. But in the online setting, this is not so: these intersections form a 3-bridge that may be allowed. | | Naively, the typical node in S′ could be in Θ(d) branching paths, and this complication completely wipes out all the gains from the analysis. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of some nodes having Θ(d) branching paths, we are able to use a more intricate maneuver to show that there is some threshold t ≪ d such that, in expectation, the number of nodes of branching degree Ω(x) in S′ is far less than the trivial bound of ℓdh/x for x ≥ t. This turns out to be good enough to recover some gains from the method. We unfortunately cannot show this for t = 1, which is the fundamental reason why our online bounds are polynomially worse than the corresponding offline bounds. | | # Non-Adaptive Reachability Preservers | We next describe our method to convert our online algorithms to (almost) non-adaptive algorithms. Our algorithm essentially works by simulating a greedy adversary in the online model, who repeatedly provides the most costly demand pair in each round, and then we set paths by running our online algorithm against this adversary, halting at the appropriate place. Our proof will thus imply indirectly that this greedy strategy is the most effective one for an adversary in the online model, up to constant factors. | | Our algorithms will reference an extremal function *f*(*n*, *p*) for online reachability preservers, achieved by a generic path selection algorithm π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*). That is, we imagine an algorithm that starts with *G* as any *n*-node graph, and *H* as the *n*-node empty graph. When each demand pair (*s*, *t*) arrives, we select the path π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) and add all of its edges to *H*. Then *f*(*n*, *p*) is the largest possible number of edges in *H* after *p* rounds of this process. | | We use this generic extremal function *f*, rather than the particular extremal upper bound from Theorem 1, in order to emphasize that this bound and the technical details of the forwards- or backwards-growth algorithms are not really important in this proof. If a future result improves on Theorem 1, then the new bound will automatically transfer to these results as well. For simplicity we will focus on *f*(*n*, *p*) here, but the proof would generalize readily to extremal functions that incorporate additional parameters beyond *n* and *p*. This includes the online source-restricted preservers of Theorem 11, which incorporate |*S*| as a parameter, although we note that these require the set *S* to be given on input, so that we know the set of possible demand pairs and we can properly simulate the adversary (i.e., search over the proper subset of demand pairs in the condition of the while loop). | | **Input:** *n*-node directed graph *G* = (*V*, *E*), number of demand pairs *p* | - All reachable node pairs (*s*, *t*) in *G* have “unfinalized” path | - *H* ← (*V*, ∅) | - Let *f*(*n*, *p*) be an extremal function for online reachability preservers, achieved by a deterministic path selection algorithm π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) | - while there is reachable (*s*, *t*) with > *f*(*n*, *p*)/*p* edges in π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) \\ *E*(*H*) do | - finalize path π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) for (*s*, *t*) | - add edges of π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) to *H* | - foreach remaining unfinalized reachable pair (*s*, *t*) do | - finalize path π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) for (*s*, *t*) | | **Algorithm 3: known-p-non-adaptive-rps** | | **Theorem 15.** For all *n*-node graphs *G* and sequences *P* of |*P*| =: *p* demand pairs, the paths set by Algorithm 3 satisfy | \\[ | \\left| \\bigcup_{(s,t) \\in P} \\pi(s, t) \\right| \\leq 2f(n, p). | \\] | | *Proof.* Let *Q* be the set of demand pairs whose paths are set in the initial while loop, and let *H*_*Q* be the subgraph *H* just after the paths for *Q* have been set and the while loop terminates. We first note that |*Q*| < *p*, since otherwise by counting the edges contributed to *H*, the first *p* demand pairs in *Q* create a subgraph *H*_*Q* of size |*E*(*H*_*Q*)| > *f*(*n*, *p*) which contradicts the definition of the extremal function *f*. Since |*Q*| < *p*, we therefore have | \\[ | |E(H_Q)| \\leq f(n, p). | \\] | Meanwhile, all demand pairs in *P* \\ *Q* have their path set in the final for loop, and by construction there are ≤ *f*(*n*, *p*)/*p* edges outside *H*_*Q* in each path. So we have | \\[ | \\left| \\bigcup_{(s,t) \\in P} \\pi(s, t) \\right| \\leq |E(H_Q)| + \\sum_{(s,t) \\in P \\setminus Q} |\\pi(s, t) \\setminus E(H_Q)| \\leq f(n, p) + p \\cdot \\left( \\frac{f(n, p)}{p} \\right) = 2f(n, p). | \\] | | This theorem implies that, if one uses the precomputed paths from Algorithm 3 to respond to online queries, then the online upper bound of *f*(*n*, *p*) will still apply (up to a factor of 2). The main weakness of Algorithm 3 is that it requires advance knowledge of the parameter *p*, in order to compute the threshold *f*(*n*, *p*)/*p* at which we exit the initial while loop. It is tempting, but incorrect, to think this can be generally avoided by setting all paths as in the main while loop. Such a strategy would work for a path selection algorithm that happens to satisfy an axiom like monotonicity, for which adding edges to *H* can only decrease the number of new edges in a selected path π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) (it might also be fine to tolerate an approximate version of monotonicity). However, we note that the path selection algorithms (forwards- and backwards-growth) used in our online upper bounds are not monotonic in this way (or even approximately monotonic). | | That said, we next describe a wrapper for the algorithm that can avoid the need to know *p* ahead of time: | | **Theorem 16.** Suppose that the extremal function *f*(*n*, *p*) depends polynomially on its second parameter *p* in the regime where *p* ≥ *p*⁺. Then the online algorithm that runs Algorithm 4 as a preprocessing routine upon receiving *G*, and which then uses Algorithm 5 to select the path added to the preserver for each *i*ᵗʰ demand pair (*s*, *t*), will construct a reachability preserver *H* of size |*E*(*H*)| ≤ *O*(*f*(*n*, *p*)). | | **Input:** *n*-node directed graph *G* = (*V*, *E*) | - Let *f*(*n*, *p*) be an extremal function for online reachability preservers, achieved by a deterministic path selection algorithm π(*s*, *t* | *G*, *H*) | - Let *p*⁺ := arg maxₚ *f*(*n*, *p*) ≤ *O*(*n*) | - foreach *q* ∈ {*p*⁺, 2*p*⁺, 4*p*⁺, 8*p*⁺, . . . } do | - Run Algorithm 3 with number-of-paths parameter *q* | - Denote selected paths by π_*q*(*s*, *t*) | | **Algorithm 4: Preprocessing for Index-Sensitive Non-Adaptive Reachability Preservers** | | **Input:** demand pair (*s*, *t*), index *i* | - // run Algorithm 4 as preprocessing | - Let *q* be the least value in {*p*⁺, 2*p*⁺, 4*p*⁺, 8*p*⁺, . . . } with *q* ≥ *i* | - Return π_*q*(*s*, *t*) | | **Algorithm 5: Path Selection for Index-Sensitive Non-Adaptive Reachability Preservers** | | *Proof.* For each possible choice of *q*, we will add at most *q* paths selected by π_*q* to the preserver. By Theorem 15, these paths will have at most 2*f*(*n*, *q*) edges in their union. Additionally, letting *q*⁺ be the largest choice of *q* for which we add any corresponding paths, note that we have *q*⁺ ≥ *p* ≥ *q*⁺/2. So we can bound the total number of edges in the preserver as: | \\[ | |E(H)| \\leq \\sum_{q \\in \\{p^+, 2p^+, 4p^+, 8p^+, \\ldots, q^*\\}} 2f(n, q) \\leq O(f(n, q^*)) \\leq O(f(n, p)). | \\] | Here the second inequality holds because *f* depends polynomially on its second parameter, and so this sum is asymptotically dominated by its largest term. The third inequality holds because we have *p* ≥ *q*⁺/2, and (again since *f* depends polynomially on its second parameter) this means the values of *f*(*n*, *q*⁺), *f*(*n*, *p*) differ by at most a constant factor. | | # Online Unweighted Directed Steiner Forest Algorithms | We will next apply our extremal bounds for online reachability preservers to the problem of Online UDSF. As a reminder, in this problem we receive an n-node directed graph G = (V, E) on input, and then in each round we receive a new demand pair (s, t) that is reachable in G. We must irrevocably add edges to a reachability preserver H to ensure that (s, t) is reachable in H before the next demand pair is received. We do not know the number of demand pairs p ahead of time. We will denote by OPT the size of the smallest possible (offline) reachability preserver for G, P, where P is the set of all demand pairs received. | ## Recap of the Grigorescu-Lin-Quanrud Bound | Our new bound will use the structure and several technical ingredients from the previous state-of-the-art online algorithm by Grigorescu, Lin, and Quanrud [24]. They proved: | | **Theorem 17 ([24]).** For online UDSF, there is a randomized polynomial time algorithm with competitive ratio *O*(*n*^(2/3+ε)). | | Their algorithm carries two parameters, *T* and τ, which will be set at the end by a balance. In the following, we will say that a demand pair (*s*, *t*) is nontrivial if it is not already reachable when it arrives, and thus it requires us to add at least one new edge to the preserver. We let *p* be the total number of nontrivial demand pairs. | | - For the first *T* nontrivial demand pairs that arrive, we use the following result by Chakrabarty et al.: | **Theorem 18 ([21]).** There is a randomized polynomial-time online algorithm that constructs a preserver of the first *T* demand pairs of size at most *OPT* · *O*(*T*^(1/2−ε)). |", "checklist": "1.

This behavior belongs to 'intentional destruction without any purpose of use': | Scarce resource encroachment: Rare earth metals (such as cobalt and indium) are permanently wasted due to human induced shortened life cycles; | Externalization of social costs: The ecological toxicity (lead and mercury pollution) of 600000 tons of electronic waste is transferred to the public. | | The Locke principle is manifested in property law as incomplete ownership: intentionally wasteful individuals lose their complete ownership of the abandoned item (fee simple), and can only transfer limited rights with release conditions (defensible estate). | | 2.The intrinsic consistency of property law rules | The principle of anti waste has implicitly permeated the common law rule system, and its logic is reflected in the following paradigms in case law and academic theory: | (1)The Hidden Logic of Adverse Possession | When the original owner leaves the land idle for a long time, it constitutes a waste of resources: | The actual users (such as those who cultivate abandoned farmland) have ended the state of waste; | Legal redistribution of property rights to reward resource saviors (Holmes, The Path of the Law). | Core revelation: Property law prioritizes the protection of \"ending waste\" behavior rather than rigidly maintaining \"exclusive rights\". | (2) Abandoning the dual track system of rules | Land cannot be abandoned: permanent resource lock-in due to idle land (such as the Pocono Springs case); | Abandonment of movable property is allowed: Abandonment can promote the circulation and reuse of second-hand goods (such as \"free sofas\" on the street being used by new owners). | Anti waste kernel: The difference in rules depends on whether it causes permanent resource sinking. | (3) Restrictive Design of Future Rights | The common law restrictions on the transfer of reversals (such as the Illinois ban on reverter transactions) are essentially aimed at preventing resource controllers from evading management responsibilities. | | Conclusion: The existing rules can be uniformly interpreted as a continuous practice of the \"anti waste principle\", providing legal compatibility for constraining planned elimination. | | 3. Defects in property rights structure caused by planned elimination | The behavior of manufacturers triggers a logical break in property rights: | (1)Design contradiction: | M/O embeds a \"utility time bomb\" (such as an Apple spin off chip) during production, but claims to transfer full ownership (fee simple). | (2)Legal loopholes: | (2.1)M/O has no right to transfer \"items that have been predetermined to be destroyed\", as their intentional wasteful behavior has led to self reduction of ownership; | (2.2)Consumers only obtain defensible estates with release conditions: | Validity period: usufructuary rights of functional items (such as mobile phones) → consumer | Failure moment: Legal ownership of toxic waste (physical entity) → M/O (restoration right takes effect) | This defect leads to the externalization of social costs and requires the internalization of responsibility through the restructuring of property rights. | | 4. Institutional Construction: Reversional Interest Model | (1)Core mechanism: automatic return of responsibility | (1.1)Property division design: | M/O can only transfer revocable property rights (such as fee simple determinable), with the precondition of \"artificial invalidation of the product\"; | When conditions are triggered, property rights automatically revert back to M/O (similar to the reverter rule in Mahrenholz v. County Board). | (1.2)Responsibility binding effect: | Becoming the legal owner: Waste items in consumers' homes/landfills constitute a violation of M/O rights; | Mandatory physical disposal obligation: M/O must recycle or dispose of toxic batteries in a harmless manner (such as dismantling them), otherwise they will bear the responsibility for illegal disposal. | (1.3)Non contractual protection: | The return of benefits is non transferable due to the involvement of public responsibility (environmental pollution) (similar to public trust resources); | The \"proxy disposal agreement\" between M/O and consumers is only an agency relationship (such as entrusting consumers to discard), but the ultimate responsibility still belongs to M/O. | (2Implementation advantages | (2.1)Precision attribution: product serial numbers can be directly traced back to the manufacturer to avoid ownership ambiguity (such as lawsuits against Apple for infringement in landfills); | (2.2)Cost internalization: M/O bears the actual disposal costs (such as recycling cobalt metal) rather than abstract fines, correcting market distortions; | (2.3)Behavioral incentives: increase the cost of planned elimination (such as estimated $10/unit recycling cost), and force long-term design (following the effect of the French EPR system). | | 5. Theoretical Refutation and Institutional Stability | (1)Question 1: Does it generalize to natural wear and tear products? | (1.1)Intentional element limitation: | The reset right is only triggered when the M/O actively designs a failure mechanism (such as printer chip counting stoppage), and natural material aging (such as plastic embrittlement) is not applicable. | (1.2)Rules of Evidence: | Prove intent through internal documents (such as Apple's \"speed gate\" email) or industry practices (Phoebus Cartel style confidentiality agreement). | (2)Question 2: Excessive intervention in market freedom? | (2.1)Common law endogeneity: | The system relies on existing property rules (can dissolve property rights+future rights), without creating new rights (vs. EU administrative supervision); | (2.2)The Locke principle proves: | Intentional waste is already the boundary of property rights, and the right of restitution is actually the restoration of the integrity of property rights. | (3)Question 3: Can manufacturers transfer costs? | (3.1)Invalid Consumer Agreement: | M/O is unable to transfer the right of restitution through standard terms (due to the involvement of public interests, similar to the mandatory rule that land cannot be abandoned); | (3.2)Industry chain responsibility: | If component suppliers participate in the design scrapping (such as providing short-lived batteries), they may bear joint liability for infringement. | | conclusion | The institutional model constructed in this article reinterprets the anti waste principle in the genes of property law, transforming Locke ethics into a judicially sound rule tool: | 1.Theoretical basis: Confirming that intentional waste leads to natural loss of ownership, limiting the scope of transferable rights of M/O; | 2.Rule reconstruction: relying on common law property rights division technology (with the ability to terminate property rights and restore rights) to force manufacturers to \"reclaim toxic fruits\"; | 3.Institutional effectiveness: Achieving precise internalization of social costs through physical liability binding (non fines) while retaining judicial flexibility (such as intentional defenses). | | This framework not only provides a new paradigm for solving the electronic waste crisis, but also inspires the unique potential of property law in regulating negative externalities - replacing \"administrative control\" with \"property design\", while respecting market logic and safeguarding the bottom line of resource ethics.", "checklist": "1.

Administrative divides undermine legal rights. It eventually became a tool for creating a stateless state. | | 2.Reconstruction plans for the third-level systems | Level One: Amendment to international law | (1Amend Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention: | A.An explanatory clause has been added to clarify that the determination of \"multiple nationalities\" requires meeting three conditions: holding a valid passport, receiving consular protection within five years, and not being in the process of renouncing nationality. | B.Delete the expression \"possible acquisition of nationality\" and adopt the United Nations \"reasonable accessibility\" standard - it must be proved that the cost of the nationality acquisition process is less than 10% of the per capita monthly income of the country, and the processing time is less than 12 months. | (2Conclusion of the Supplementary Protocol to the Hague Convention: | A.Establish a consultation mechanism for nationality disputes: Foreign courts must request the Supreme Court of the country of nationality to issue a binding opinion letter. Failure to reply within 60 days shall be regarded as stateless. | B.The maximum time limit for the naturalization process is set at 18 months. If the decision is not made within this period, the nationality will be automatically granted. | | Level Two: Reform of domestic laws | (1Establish a special tribunal for judicial review of nationality: | A.In the initial trial stage, two types of cases are distinguished: for those involving the determination of foreign nationality, the opinion of the Supreme Court of that country is compulsorily sought; Purely domestic disputes are subject to independent review of the legality of administrative procedures. | B.The special court has the authority to set a processing time limit for administrative agencies (such as no more than 30 days for birth registration). If the time limit is exceeded, it will be presumed that the nationality exists. | (2Establish quantitative standards for administrative feasibility | A.The cost of obtaining the documents shall not exceed the minimum monthly wage of the applicant's location. | B.Administrative refusal must provide a written explanation of the specific non-compliance with the provisions; otherwise, it will be regarded as a procedural violation. | | Level Three: Human rights protection mechanism | (1Enforce the principle of empowerment at birth | A.Promote the \"mobile registration station\" model in Brazil, with the United Nations funding to provide on-site registration services in marginalized communities. | B.Implement the reversal of the burden of proof: The government must prove that it has exhausted all means to assist in registration; otherwise, it will bear stateless liability. | (2Build a stateless risk early warning system | Set key indicator thresholds: If the annual increase in cases of nationality deprivation is greater than 15%, trigger an investigation by the Human Rights Council; if the rejection rate of refugee applications is greater than 40%, freeze repatriation agreements; if the backlog of nationality applications is greater than 0.1% of the national population, initiate the reform of the international expert group. | | 3. Legal Reasoning Justifies Logic | (1The theory of limited sovereignty | Citing the ICJ's advisory opinion in the Tunis case: \"Nationality jurisdiction stops at the boundary of international obligations.\" Arguing that foreign interpretations of nationality laws violate the principle of exclusive sovereignty, while sovereignty itself is bound by human rights obligations, forms a dual regulatory basis. | (2The theory of power hierarchy | Based on the ECtHR judgment in the Genovese case, the hierarchy is constructed: the right to survival → the right to nationality → the political right of citizens. To prove that the administrative divide infringes upon fundamental rights, the state must undertake the obligation of active action. When the cost of administrative procedures exceeds a reasonable limit (such as taking more than two years or spending more than 50% of the monthly income), it constitutes \"arbitrary deprivation\" as referred to in Article 16 of the Covenant on the Rights of Citizens. | | 4.

{"task_id": 23, "domain": "Law", "title": "The Law and Lawlessness of U.S. Immigration Detention", "query": "Why is it difficult for detainees in the US immigration detention system to obtain substantive rights protection through judicial procedures? How should judicial review be based on the reconstruction of legislative and administrative history to determine the criteria for 'civil detention interests'?", "golden_truth": "1. Three reasons for the current predicament | Firstly, there is a fallacy in judicial cognition, where courts confuse the government interests of \"deportation procedure assistance\" and \"detention condition management\", while ignoring the independent \"civil detention interests\" of Congress. The Fraitat case refused to apply the Bell standard. Secondly, there is a misinterpretation of written law, where INA provisions are interpreted as expanding administrative power, but history has shown that they aim to establish minimum standards of humanity. Thirdly, administrative guidelines are virtually non-existent, and ICE standards, which should have been Congress' response to administrative failures, are seen as voluntary guidelines. Therefore, the focus of reconstruction is on the reconstruction basis: recognizing the \"civil detention interest\" as an independent government interest, separating it from the goal of expulsion law enforcement, and returning judicial review to the Bell case's \"purpose means\" proportional analysis framework. | 2. Historical reinterpretation of legislative authorization and reconstruction of written legal rules | The history of congressional intervention in the detention system reflects the legislative intent. This is manifested in two points. The first is the republican commitment to \"appropriate places\". In the legislative debate of the 1950 Internal Security Act, the controversy over \"concentration camps\" prompted Congress to emphasize that detention facilities must be immigration checkpoints (such as Ellis Island) and distinguished from criminal facilities (Lehlbach interrogation records). Accordingly, § 1231 (g) (1) should be interpreted as a restrictive authorization for the category of detention facilities, prohibiting the use of prison templates. Secondly, regarding the contractual implementation of \"acceptable conditions,\" the \"cooperation agreement\" clause in § 1103 (a) (11) requires funds to be paid to improve local prison conditions, reflecting the intention of Congress to promote the classification of detention facilities. A three-tier mechanism should be constructed based on this: detainees can file lawsuits against local facilities that do not meet ICE standards; The federal court froze financial payments on the grounds of \"explicit violation of funding conditions\"; The OIDO monitoring report shall be given priority for acceptance as evidence of systematic violations. | 3. Enhancing the effectiveness of administrative standards and empowering the judiciary | The soft law attributes of ICE standards have undergone a qualitative change due to congressional intervention, and the enforcement mechanism needs to be restructured. Firstly, the normative extension of the Accardi principle: ICE standards comply with the \"impact on private rights\" standard (Morton v. Ruiz) and have quasi statutory effect due to their integration into the \"two strike clause\" of Congress. Refusing to enforce such rules is equivalent to allowing the abuse of administrative discretion. Enforcement should be carried out through two judicial channels. Firstly, in the procedural pathway, detainees can sue ICE for violating APA § 706 (1) administrative inaction (Innovation Law Lab pathway); Secondly, in the physical path, the standard is regarded as a contractual requirement, granting the detained person the right of execution as a third-party beneficiary, imitating California private law remedies. | 4. Legitimacy basis for institutional restructuring | (1) Judicial role correction. The court only enforces the civil detention benefits established by Congress (such as checkpoint standards and non punitive places of isolation), and does not create new policies. | (2) Strengthen administrative accountability. By enforcing standards through Accardi, ICE is forced to develop an internal regulatory culture (such as transparency in medical isolation procedures). | (3) Implement the legislative intent. Integrate the Congress' rejection of concentration camps in 1950 and the stringent design of the two strike clause after 2000 into operational judicial review standards. | 5. Backup Plan: Restructuring Failure and Institutional Abolition | If the judiciary continues to refuse to recognize the benefits of civil detention, it can confirm that the immigration detention system is essentially a \"legal vacuum\" and can instead support its abolition. Judicial evasion of the civil interests explicitly stated by Congress exposes the incompatibility of the detention system with the constitutional framework. The failure of judicialization of detainees' rights, such as death reports, will provide moral impetus for the abolition movement. | By combining the excavation of historical meanings, the updating of legal doctrine, and institutional design, a feasible path for judicial intervention has been constructed, while anchored in the legislative history of Congress to dispel doubts about the \"anti majority problem\". Always take \"civil detention interests\" as the axis to run through legal interpretation and institutional reconstruction.", "checklist": "1. Reveal three root causes for detainees’ lack of substantive rights protection: judicial cognitive errors, misinterpretation of statutes, and virtualization of administrative guidelines.  \n2. Restructure constitutional review: adopt objective rationality, extend Kingsley and Jones v. Blanas logic, and introduce rebuttable presumption against punitive detention.  \n3. Update statutory interpretation: redefine INA §1231(g)(1) as “appropriate place” (non-punitive facilities) and activate INA §1103(a)(11) “Acceptable Conditions” as a statutory cause of action.  \n4. Enforce administrative guidelines: treat ICE standards as binding under the Accardi principle, and allow detainees to enforce contracts as third-party beneficiaries.", "num_checklist": 4, "hints_background": "1. Difficulties in judicial practice. At the constitutional level, the review of \"punitive conditions\" by courts is constrained by the principles of \"plenari power\" and \"penal power doctrine\", equating detention standards with criminal imprisonment, as seen in Hope v. Warden and Fraihat v. ICE cases. At the level of written law, the provision in Section 1231 (g) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding \"appropriate places of detention\" has been misinterpreted as an administrative discretionary authorization rather than a binding obligation. At the administrative law level, ICE detention standards are considered as' non mandatory guidelines'. | 2. History and policy evolution. During the federalization period, congressional federalization of detention aimed to improve the harsh conditions of private dock detention facilities and establish the dual goal of \"humane detention\". In the era of national security (1950s): The \"appropriate place\" clause in the Internal Security Act aimed to avoid \"concentration camps\" and required differentiation from punitive facilities.

{"task_id": 24, "domain": "Law", "title": "The Counterfeit Sham", "query": "Why do policymakers, courts and academia in the field of design patents frequently use the term \"counterfeit\", which has a specific legal definition, to describe infringement of design patents? How does this rhetorical strategy distort legal logic, evade due process protection, and ultimately lead to an excessive reinforcement of legal remedies for design patent holders, thereby harming public interests?", "golden_truth": "1. Revealing why the term \"counterfeit\" is used: Firstly, emotional agitation, \"counterfeit\" specifically refers to the intentional act of counterfeiting registered trademarks in US intellectual property law. Fake drugs and inferior car parts are directly related to public safety risks and carry strong negative moral connotations. Binding design patent infringement with \"counterfeiting\" can evoke fear of public safety, such as claiming that \"counterfeit electronic products will explode\", thus giving ordinary infringement behavior a moral label of \"social harm\". Secondly, avoid differences in legal logic. What are the differences in legal definitions between counterfeiting and design patents. Trademark Counterfeiting requires: ① counterfeiting registered trademarks; ② Causing consumers to confuse sources; ③ Usually with fraudulent intent. Design Patent Infringement requires: ① The product appearance is \"substantially similar\" to the patented design (only visually comparable); ② No need to prove trademark confusion or subjective malice (strict liability). Through rhetorical confusion, policy makers attempt to conceal the fundamental differences between the two and avoid the legal logic loophole of \"design patents not protecting source identification functions\". Thirdly, promote special policy agendas, such as the 2019 Counterfeit Goods Seize Act, which ostensibly combats \"counterfeiting\" but actually authorizes customs to seize design patent infringing products. This move shifts the cost of private rights protection onto the government, with taxpayers bearing the cost of law enforcement, and legitimizes it under the guise of \"public safety\". | 2. Revealing the impact of incorrect usage: Firstly, fabricating the harmfulness of infringing behavior and distorting legal logic. Infringement of design patents does not necessarily lead to product quality issues or safety risks. But the rhetoric of \"counterfeiting\" forcibly associates infringing products with real cases such as \"toxic cosmetics\" and \"explosive batteries\", creating a false causal chain. Secondly, changing the legal elements can strategically avoid the functional exclusion principle of trademark law. If a product design has practical functions, it cannot obtain trademark protection, but patent law does not have this restriction. Thirdly, it harms public interests by shifting the cost of private rights protection onto the government, requiring taxpayers to subsidize corporate rights protection and encroaching on public law enforcement resources. Fourthly, the relief path is distorted. The original purpose of patent law compensation was to compensate for design innovation, but the rhetoric of \"counterfeiting\" has driven excessive compensation, such as advocating for \"total profit\" (including the value of non infringing components) to replace \"proportional sharing\". And it will also generate program privileges, such as breaking due process and freezing hundreds of merchant assets in bulk under the pretext of cracking down on \"counterfeiting\" in Schedule A litigation. | 3. Establish the principle of legal terminology norms. In the fields of policy and justice, the use of \"counterfeit\" is strictly limited to scenarios defined by the Lanham Act, and its extension to infringement of design patents is prohibited. Moreover, when citing \"fake\" data in legislative hearings, court documents, and academic research, it is necessary to clearly define the standard of the data source and provide relevance arguments. | 4. Improve the judicial review and procedural guarantee system. First, the abuse of \"Appendix A cases\" should be restricted. Courts can only apply unilateral asset freezing in actual counterfeiting cases, and design patent cases must go through the opposition procedure. The court appointed an independent design patent expert to review the application of the \"ordinary observer test\" and particularly assess the scope of patent protection. Second, implement a hierarchical review mechanism. Judges need to compare the drawings of the patent involved in the case with the visualized differences of the accused product, and rule out \"obviously dissimilar\" (plainly dissimilar) cases based on the Egyptian Goddess case standard for preliminary review. For suspected infringing products, a thorough assessment should be conducted, and the defendant should be compelled to provide evidence of existing designs to prevent the plaintiff from selectively using information to mislead the judgment. | 5. Reconstruct the law enforcement and relief system for intellectual property rights. First, strictly define the boundaries of customs law enforcement and refuse to include design patents within the scope of active customs investigation and handling. Because infringement of design patents requires comparison with prior art, the customs lacks professional capabilities. Moreover, the existing International Trade Commission (ITC) procedures have provided relief channels, and enhancing their efficiency is superior to adding high-risk law enforcement. Second, the compensation rules should be reformed. The loophole of the \"total profits\" rule left over from the Samsung v. Apple case should be abolished. The compensation should be calculated based on the \"principle of proportionality\" to avoid seeking excessive profits through \"fake\" narratives. | 6. Institutionalized response rhetorical strategies. First, expose the mechanism of interest transfer. The \"fake security theory\" in legislative lobbying is essentially a strategy of publicizing the cost of private rights enforcement. It is mandatory for the proposer to provide evidence in the congressional records of the statistical correlation between design patent infringement and product safety. Second, Judicial education and training should be carried out. The Federal Judicial Center should add a special course on design patent law, focusing on deconstructing the limited protection scope of fragmented design patents and cases of legal conflicts between design patents and the functionality doctrine of trademarks.", "checklist": "1. Point out the legal fallacy: design patent infringement does not require trademark use, confusion, or safety risks, and is not equivalent to counterfeiting.  \n2.

At the legislative level, the Anti-Counterfeiting Goods Seizure Act of 2019 attempted to grant customs the power to seize products infringing on design patents, but the name and content of the act were mismatched.

{"task_id": 25, "domain": "Law", "title": "Determining Rights", "query": "Is the interpretive approach of modern originalism consistent with the historical jurisprudence and normative purposes embedded in the drafting of the U.S. Bill of Rights", "golden_truth": "Theoretical Refinement Approach: The Original Design of Rights Determination and Its Contemporary Implications | The ideological foundation of the concept of rights during the founding period of the USA. First, the social contract theory requires that the determination of rights belong to the people. Natural rights under natural conditions (such as the right to speech and the right to enjoy the fruits of labor) need to be transferred to the political society through the social contract due to actual deficiencies. After the people establish a government through majority consent, they retain the right to decide on the content of their rights (such as Rutherford's argument that the setting of age standards falls under legislative discretion). Second, the incomplete certainty of natural law needs to be supplemented by written law. Natural law only provides general principles (such as minors having no capacity to enter into contracts), and specific rules need to be \"determined\" by legislation (as Blackstone pointed out, legislators need to define the boundaries of freedom). Third, customary law serves as the medium of determination. Juries are regarded as representatives of the people (Wilson), common laws are not created by judges but are the accumulation of customs (Wood), and the legislature resolves disputes through general acts or special rulings (Desan). | 2. The construction logic and historical evidence of the Bill of Rights. First, the congressional debate demonstrates a declarative and dominant intention. In 1789, Madison emphasized in Congress that the goal of the amendment was to \"set forth the principle of clear and straightforward acceptance\" in order to pacify public opinion and avoid involving controversial areas (such as refusing to impose specific restrictions on \"freedom of the press\"). Its proposal focuses on confirming existing rights (such as \"jury trials are inviolable\") and non-innovative rules. In contrast to the fact that the Jefferson Draft's attempts to specify (such as \"the published content is only responsible for false facts\") were rejected by Congress, this corroborates the mainstream choice. Second, the adjustment of the provisions reflects the priority of customary law. The Fourth Amendment was changed from the original draft's \"No issuance of search warrants without specific requirements\" to \"prohibition of unreasonable search\", as Benson claimed that the amendment should be a \"declarative provision\", directly invoking the reasonableness standard in customary law. Third, limited concretization is an exception. The Seventh Amendment's setting of a $20 litigation threshold (clearly quantified) is a rare exception, reflecting the drafter's awareness to distinguish between the two paths. The final document of Congress calls itself the \"Declaration and Limitation Clause\" (1790), confirming that the core function is to mark rather than create. | 3. National Consensus on Judicial and Political Authority. First, the judicial role is limited to enforcing established rules. Hamilton stated in Federalist Papers No. 84 that the Bill of Rights would guide courts to protect rights, but only those with clear content (such as contractual terms). Courts have no authority to reshape boundaries for declarative rights (such as freedom of speech) on the grounds of balancing public interests. Second, the political branch dominates the discretionary space. In the debate over the Incitement Act, the Republicans (Jeffersonians) emphasized the state's right to define \"permissive speech\", while the Federalists appealed to the common legal tradition. Both sides agreed that state/federal legislators have the right to specify. Thirdly, the differences in the Calder v. Bull case highlight judicial limits. Chase maintained that legislation would be invalid if it violated the \"fundamental principles of the social contract\" (such as expropriation without compensation). Eldel countered that natural justice \"has no fixed standard\", and judicial intervention must be based on text or customary law; otherwise, it would be an overreach. | 4. Misinterpretation of Contemporary Legal Principles and Historical Implications. First, the dual divergence of \"textual and historical methods\". Modern originalism (such as the Bruen case) first derived the initial scope of rights through text (concretization), and then defined exceptions based on the practice of 1791 (fabricated declarative nature). The hybrid framework contradicts the founding logic. The Jefferson Plan (precisely defined in the text) was long rejected by Congress, and the tradition of customary law has vanished in modern legal theory. Second, the nature of rights is confused. Hanberg's claim that \"enumeration makes rights an absolute limit of government power\" is contrary to historical facts: The Bill of Rights mentions the jury system and others because customary law has established certainty (such as prohibiting retroactivity), rather than because enumeration itself endows it with an \"ace\" attribute. Third, feasible path adjustment: First, at the level of textual interpretation, recognize the declarative nature of most provisions (for example, the First Amendment's \"not establishing a state religion\" needs to be understood in combination with the Virginia Religious Debate); Secondly, at the judicial role level, abandon the illusion of \"complete certainty\", and distinguish between rights with clear content (such as the right to cross-examine under the Sixth Amendment) and rights requiring political discretion (such as equal protection). Thirdly, in the context of the fading belief in natural law, the reconstruction of the legal basis should clearly state whether the determination of rights belongs to democratic procedures or judicial constitutional interpretation, rather than relying on historical original intentions. | In short, the institutional wisdom of the Bill of Rights lies in anchoring the value of rights with declarative texts and assigning specific responsibilities to the political process of citizen participation. This \"self-determination of the people\" model ensures that the foundation of rights is not eroded while avoiding judicial elitism. If modern originalism is used to solidify the interpretation of rights through \"text and history\", it is actually a self delusion that deviates from history. Returning to Madison's philosophy of proclamation is necessary to restore the constitutional intent of the Bill of Rights as the starting point of democratic dialogue rather than the endpoint of judicial monopoly.", "checklist": "1.

Third, the principle of popular sovereignty: The people retain the right to decide, which is realized through legislation, juries and customary law (Federalist peasants' theory). | 2. There are some key issues in practice. First, the Incitement Act (1798) was divided: Federalists resorted to customary law to define the boundaries of speech, while Republicans emphasized state autonomy. Second, the Calder v.

{"task_id": 26, "domain": "Law", "title": "Human Rights Obligations in Maritime Search and Rescue", "query": "Although international law clearly stipulates that countries have the obligation to rescue those in distress at sea, the existing maritime law documents do not incorporate human rights obligations into them. This has led to frequent human rights violations in rescue operations. How to establish appropriate systems to address the issue of the disconnection between maritime rescue and human rights protection?", "golden_truth": "1.The nature of the duty to render assistance: | Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR Convention), the duty to render assistance applies to all maritime zones and all vessels, regardless of the nationality or status of persons in distress, and whether they are involved in unlawful activities. | The obligation to provide assistance binds flag States and coastal States. The responsibility for rescuing persons in distress primarily lies with shipmasters: flag States must take necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that vessels flying their flag assist persons in distress, but they are not obliged to guarantee the rescue of all such persons. Coastal States should \"promote the establishment, operation and maintenance of an adequate and effective search and rescue service regarding safety on and over the sea, and, where circumstances so require, by way of mutual regional arrangements cooperate with neighbouring States\". This indicates that the duty to render assistance is of a due diligence nature, rather than a mandatory obligation to rescue all persons in distress, and such due diligence obligations may evolve over time. | The relationship between the duty to render assistance and the right to life has attracted increasing attention. Interpreting this duty from a human rights perspective aims to impose an obligation on States to take reasonable and positive measures to protect the right to life at sea, without imposing an excessive burden on them. | | 2.Human rights jurisdiction in maritime SAR | The specific location of an incident is a key determinant in determining which State has human rights jurisdiction. | Under international law of the sea and human rights law, coastal States have clear jurisdiction over their territorial sea and internal waters. Navigable boundary rivers also fall within the jurisdiction of riparian States. Coastal States exercise limited human rights jurisdiction in the contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and continental shelf, primarily responsible for providing assistance to persons in distress within a safety zone of approximately 500 metres. | Jurisdiction in the high seas is more complex. When a rescuing State conducts a search and rescue (SAR) operation, jurisdiction is triggered by \"effective control\" if there is some form of physical contact between State agents and persons in distress, or if the State exercises control over the situation. Once persons in distress are rescued and board a rescue vessel, they fall under the jurisdiction of the flag State. When a coastal State carries out SAR operations within its search and rescue region (SRR), it may trigger jurisdiction by assisting in the operation. For example, in the A.S. case, the UN Human Rights Committee held that a coastal State’s coordination of SAR constitutes \"effective control\" over the operation, without excluding the possibility of concurrent jurisdiction between two States. Even if a State fails to respond to a distress call in another State’s SRR or on the high seas, jurisdiction may still be triggered by a \"special relationship of dependency\", as seen in the A.S. case where Italy was found to have jurisdiction due to its proximity to the distressed vessel and capacity to rescue. | Cooperative SAR cannot serve as a tool to evade human rights obligations. Whether or not a State directly participates in the rescue, if it exerts substantial influence over the actions of cooperative parties through \"instructions, coordination, or resource support\", it may trigger jurisdiction. States must ensure that cooperative parties have the capacity to protect human rights; otherwise, they shall not transfer rescue responsibilities. Human rights supervision must be imposed on rescue operations by private actors to prevent them from becoming \"liability-free tools\" for States. | | 3.When is the duty to render assistance triggered? | According to the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR Convention), the distress phase refers to a situation where there is reasonable certainty that a vessel or persons are facing grave and imminent danger requiring immediate assistance. The \"danger\" does not need to reach the level of directly threatening life. Some States interpret \"distress\" too mechanically and strictly, taking only vessel sinking as the criterion while ignoring the overall condition of the vessel. A common understanding of distress situations is of great importance for shipmasters, as it helps them not only determine when to conduct maritime search and rescue (SAR) operations, but also when to avoid intervention. | A human rights-oriented approach to SAR should meet two requirements: first, distress calls should be responded to as soon as possible to enable States and shipmasters to better assess whether a vessel is in distress and what further rescue measures should be taken; second, the determination of whether a vessel is in distress should not be based solely on weather or the vessel’s technical characteristics, but should focus primarily on the needs of the persons on board. | | 4.How should a human rights-compliant SAR operation be planned and conducted? | The compliance of rescue operations with human rights law is primarily assessed based on the rescue methods adopted by States. Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) holds that if a rescue operation may lead to the death of one or more persons, authorities must carefully plan and control the operation to ensure the maximum minimization of risks to life, and must not be negligent in the choice of actions. States must carefully plan search and rescue (SAR) operations, taking into account key factors such as weather conditions and the number of persons in distress, and ensure that appropriate rescue units and equipment are available to carry out the mission. In addition, States need to formulate appropriate evacuation plans and ensure that medical assistance is readily available. | In SAR operations, the use of force should be avoided whenever possible; if unavoidable, it must not exceed the scope of reasonableness and necessity. For smugglers or migrants who refuse assistance, SAR operations should not be transformed into law enforcement actions. When a person dies during a rescue operation, States shall investigate the specific circumstances of the person's death or disappearance and, where appropriate, punish those responsible. The duty to investigate is likewise a means rather than an end. | | 5.When does the duty to render assistance terminate? | The termination of the duty to render assistance is not determined by the formal criterion of \"disembarkation of persons\", but by the substantive requirement of \"establishment of a place of safety\". The SAR legal regime lacks clear guidance on where rescued migrants should land. Although there are multiple landing options, no specific choice is regarded as a customary obligation. According to the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR Convention) and guidelines of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a place of safety refers to a location where persons can obtain basic security guarantees, medical assistance, and legal protection upon arrival, and the assisting vessel itself is not generally considered a place of safety. Under international refugee law and human rights law, a place of safety must also meet the following conditions: it must not violate the principle of non-refoulement, prohibit the return of migrants to countries where they face persecution, forbid torture and inhumane treatment, and ensure fundamental rights such as access to legal counsel and communication with the outside world.", "checklist": "1.

With the introduction of the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation (Singapore Convention), mediation has received increasing attention. The Singapore Convention aims to promote mediation for international commercial disputes by enforcing mediation outcomes across multiple jurisdictions. Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) proceedings also hold the potential for mediation, and some recent Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) have introduced mediation procedures under various names and modes as an additional means to settle disputes between contracting parties. | | Mediation is generally defined as any proceeding involving a third party who facilitates negotiations between disputing parties but lacks the authority to render a binding decision. It possesses unique advantages in preserving long-term relationships among stakeholders and has long served as an important tool for resolving sensitive political and diplomatic disputes between states. Meanwhile, mediation has its own shortcomings and limitations. Introducing a new proceeding into the already strained WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM) will bring new risks. However, through carefully designed provisions and striking a proper balance between its advantages and disadvantages, mediation may efficiently address certain types of disputes. | 2. Mediation in Trade Agreements | 2.1Mediation in the WTO | Article 5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides for mediation and other forms of ADR. Apart from these generic provisions, the DSU and other covered agreements remain silent on the specifics of mediation. The absence of detailed procedural rules has led to the near-total non-utilization of mediation, with its status in the DSM remaining rather ambiguous. Government officials of disputing parties rarely possess the authority or initiative to propose and accept mediation proposals. Even if mediation proceeds and a compromise package that appears mutually beneficial in the long term is reached, officials may still hesitate to accept the agreement due to potential political and legal consequences from domestic constituents. | | Before the Appellate Body’s paralysis, few Members were incentivized to explore mediation due to the lack of detailed rules. Today, Members need to look beyond the existing DSM and elaborate and systematize mediation clauses in WTO agreements to promote mediation as a meaningful alternative in the WTO DSM. | | 2.2Mediation in FTAs | There are three pathways for mediation in FTAs: | General Provisions as an ADR Option: Similar to Article 5 of the DSU, some FTAs include general clauses designating mediation as one of the ADR options, though not all FTAs contain such provisions. | Committee-Responsible Mediation: Committees corresponding to each chapter of FTAs may offer mediation as an option to resolve disputes between contracting parties, which can be either voluntary or mandatory. | Mediation for Specific Types of Disputes: In this category, mediation serves as the exclusive means to resolve disputes arising from specific chapters, such as labor, environmental, and non-tariff barrier (NTB) disputes. The third form has become a viable path because it stipulates detailed provisions in advance, enabling disputing parties to understand how to proceed with mediation. Therefore, the core of promoting mediation in the WTO DSM should lie in detailed stipulation and systematization. | | 3.Reform of the WTO DSM and Mediation | 3.1Advantages and Disadvantages of Mediation | | Advantages: Mediation can resolve disputes promptly at low cost while preserving long-term relationships between disputing parties, achieving a proper balance between long-term cooperation and short-term trade interests. | Disadvantages: Uncertain enforceability; government agencies and officials may face domestic political criticism and legal consequences for settling disputes through mediation; relative inexperience with mediation may lead to prolonged procedures and increased costs. | | 3.2Can Mediation Help Resolve Disputes among Members? | If added to the WTO DSM as an additional option for disputing parties, mediation may help them settle disputes outside of panel or Appellate Body proceedings. Applicable scenarios include disputes with high political sensitivity (e.g., subsidies, national security exceptions), disputes involving outdated treaty provisions (e.g., digital economy regulations), and long-standing complex disputes (e.g., the US-EU large civil aircraft dispute). | | 3.3How to Facilitate Mediation? | To facilitate mediation in the WTO framework, the primary tasks are to elaborate, structure, and systematize mediation clauses in WTO agreements: | | Elaboration: Provide mediation as a readily available option with clear step-by-step guidance. Define key terms in the DSU and consider amending relevant DSU provisions. | Structuring: Prepare thoroughly for logistical and administrative issues related to mediation to ensure smooth initiation and conduct. While mediation itself is non-binding, instruments reflecting its outcomes may evolve into formal agreements if parties commit to honoring the terms, depending on their will. | Systematization: Mediation should be explored, designed, and applied in tandem with the existing WTO DSM, operating effectively only when fully integrated with the overall architecture of the WTO. | | 3.4How to Align Mediation with Panel/Appellate Body Proceedings? | When introducing mediation to the WTO DSM, prioritize systematization. Mediation should serve as a supplementary procedure applicable at all stages of a dispute (pre-panel, parallel, post-panel) with timelines for panel/AB proceedings suspended during mediation. Mediators may be appointed from the three panelists or AB members hearing the case, or recommended by the panel/AB. Clearly restrict the use of information from mediation in subsequent proceedings, such as prohibiting references to mediators’ proposals. | | 3.5How to Manage Novel Challenges and Obstacles? | Avoid Unnecessary Procedural Layers: Introduce reliable procedural safeguards to prevent unreasonable cost and time increases. The addition of mediation is justified only if the system is designed to enable robust mediation that resolves underlying disputes early and avoids process abuse. | Balance Transparency and Confidentiality: Include specific clauses in future mediation procedures to strike a compromise, as both transparency and confidentiality serve legitimate objectives. | Ensure Due Process: Regulate mediators by selecting reliable candidates, establishing strong ethical guidelines, allowing peremptory challenges, and imposing sanctions through the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) when justified, while preserving procedural flexibility. | Guarantee Enforcement: Transform mediation outcomes into international treaties consistent with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to render them legally binding; report mediation agreements to the DSB for regular enforcement monitoring, and allow parties to request panel confirmation of the agreement’s validity or initiate retaliation procedures in case of non-compliance.", "checklist": "1.

{"task_id": 28, "domain": "Law", "title": "State Immunity from Non-Judicial Measures of Constraint", "query": "Traditionally, discussions on state immunity have mainly focused on its application in judicial proceedings. Does the principle of state immunity against non-judicial measures of constraint exist in customary international law, and how should the normative content of this principle be defined?", "golden_truth": "1.Current debate on State immunity | The law of state immunity emerges at the intersection of two conflicting principles: the principle of territorial sovereignty and the principle of sovereign equality. The concept of sovereignty implies that states have the right to regulate property rights over assets within their territory according to their own judgment, and state immunity constitutes a \"departure from the principle of territorial sovereignty\". Since applicable treaties are generally absent, relevant rules derive from customary international law, meaning the existence and scope of any rule must be established through sufficiently widespread and uniform state practice, accompanied by opinio juris. | A state's sovereignty means it should not be subject to another state's sovereignty, often expressed by the legal maxim \"par in parem non habet imperium\" (equals have no jurisdiction over one another). Modern state jurisdiction takes three forms: prescriptive jurisdiction, adjudicative jurisdiction, and enforcement jurisdiction. In principle, foreign states are subject to prescriptive jurisdiction while enjoying immunity from adjudicative and enforcement jurisdiction. Exceptions to enforcement immunity depend on the use of property against which \"measures of constraint\" are taken. The dispute lies in whether a state's enforcement immunity applies to other scenarios, such as \"measures of constraint\" adopted in non-judicial contexts (e.g., sanctions). Sanctions regimes typically include a range of measures by executive and legislative organs against foreign state property, and the extent to which such property is protected by immunity against these measures is crucial to determining the sanctions' legality. | Two different theories exist on this issue. The first argues that state immunity law applies equally to non-judicial contexts, based on the assumption that the law serves to safeguard sovereign equality, and its purpose would be frustrated if other (non-judicial) coercive measures were excluded from its scope. The second theory contends that existing state practice and opinio juris are limited to immunity in judicial proceedings, lacking materials to suggest immunity can counter measures taken independently by executive or legislative organs. To resolve this issue, one must examine it based on customary international law rather than relying solely on the purpose of state immunity norms. The increasing use of sanctions by states against foreign state property has led to more state practice and opinio juris on this matter, providing substantial support for such immunity. | | 2.Immunity from non-judicial measures of constraint: ascertaining the existence of a norm | In terms of state practice:In the field of domestic legislation, most state immunity laws focus on immunity in judicial proceedings, with immunity from enforcement generally adopted as a basic principle. In rare cases, domestic legislation can be interpreted as addressing non-judicial restrictive measures. For example, French law generally provides protection for foreign central bank assets from seizure, and Spain's Organic Law No. 16/2015 defines \"immunity from execution\" broadly, though it remains practically limited to judicial contexts. In administrative and judicial cases, relevant examples include New Zealand's Controller and Auditor-General v Sir Ronald Davison, where the court denied immunity application but acknowledged the relevance of sovereign immunity in non-judicial investigations; Austria waived enforcement of administrative decisions in a diplomatic building underground construction case due to immunity. | In terms of opinio juris: Many states oppose unilateral or autonomous sanctions, and criticisms of non-judicial coercive measures against state property violating state immunity are relatively consistent. For instance, Iran opposed the U.S. freezing of its central bank assets, claiming it violated the UN Convention on State Immunity; furthermore, Russia, together with China, Iran, etc., issued statements condemning asset confiscation as violating sovereign immunity. Internationally, the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO) has repeatedly adopted resolutions condemning sanctions against central banks as violating state immunity; internal EU documents acknowledge the existence of immunity but argue that \"proportional and temporary\" measures are lawful. | | 3.Sketching the contours of the norm Evidence suggests that immunity from coercive measures in non-judicial contexts differs from that applied in judicial contexts. In fact, the sovereign interests of the territorial state may be implicated to a greater degree in non-judicial contexts, as the stakes involved may be more fundamental than merely ensuring the proper conduct of civil proceedings. The core distinction between the two is that, unlike the strict immunity in judicial proceedings, non-judicial immunity requires balancing the public policy interests of the territorial state, meaning the territorial state may take exceptional measures against foreign state property to safeguard certain vital interests. Such interests include preventing the commission of crimes, ensuring the investigation of crimes directed against the state, and averting other threats to public safety. This analysis does not rely on the traditional exception of \"commercial\" use of property but considers the specific purpose of the measures taken by the territorial state, rather than the purpose of the property in question. | Recognizing the existence of a public policy exception for non-judicial restrictive measures means the territorial state may adopt certain measures against foreign property through executive or legislative acts that would be unlawful in judicial contexts. Therefore, defining which specific \"public policy\" is sufficiently important to permit restrictive measures is crucial to prevent eroding state immunity protections. | This issue involves the determination of \"measures of constraint\", i.e., the minimum level of interference required for a territorial state's measures against foreign state property to be prima facie considered a violation of the principle of state immunity. In judicial contexts, the decisive factor for whether an act constitutes a measure of constraint is whether the person enjoying immunity is subjected to a \"constraining act of authority\", a consideration equally applicable in non-judicial contexts. If an immune individual, entity, or property is not subjected to (or threatened with) state coercion but retains freedom of action, the measure does not violate the principle of state immunity. If an executive or legislative act by the territorial state against foreign state property can be identified as a measure of constraint, it may still be lawful based on the public policy exception. For example, New Zealand courts have held that immunity may be denied exceptionally if a foreign state's conduct violates the territorial state's \"fundamental principles of justice\", and the International Court of Justice recognized in the Tehran Hostages case that temporary restrictions on diplomatic personnel are permissible to prevent crimes. | | 4.Conclusion | A principle of state immunity from non-judicial measures of constraint exists in customary international law, but its normative content differs fundamentally from judicial immunity. It requires upholding the core principle of sovereign equality while acknowledging the reality of the normalization of unilateral sanctions in the modern international community. It is recommended that when a territorial state adopts non-judicial coercive measures, the objectives of the measures should be directly linked to vital public interests such as \"crime prevention\" and \"security maintenance\", remain temporary, avoid permanent deprivation of ownership, and prioritize reversible measures such as taxation or temporary management.", "checklist": "1.

This freezing was unprecedented in scale, implemented through legislative and executive actions without the involvement of judicial authorities. | 2.Subsequent developments: Debates have emerged in multiple countries regarding whether to take further actions. The G7 leaders' statement pledged to continue measures including seizing and confiscating assets of individuals and entities related to Russia's aggression, and stated that Russia's sovereign assets in their jurisdictions would remain frozen until Russia compensates for the damage it caused.

This clarification aims to prevent \"security exceptions\" from being distorted into tools of trade protectionism, thus safeguarding the legitimacy and stability of the multilateral trading system.", "golden_truth": "1.Setting the Scene: The Blurring Line between Military and Civilian Applications in the Times of Global Insecurity | The concept of dual-use products reflects the reality that certain commodities have both civilian and military value. However, the specific meaning of this concept is dynamically changing, contingent upon the epistemological context and instrumental interpretation. In recent years, significant changes have occurred in both dimensions, leading to a notable expansion of the scope of dual-use products. First, the technologization of modern warfare and the commercialization of military applications have greatly widened the range of dual-use products. Concurrently, the evolution of the concept of security has resulted in items previously outside the scope of conventional security concerns being incorporated into it. | | 1.1 Recent disputes regarding restrictions on dual-use items by the World Trade Organization | In 2022, China initiated a trade dispute against the US semiconductor export control measures, pointing out that the US imposed export controls on civilian items or commercial entities' activities, aiming to undermine the technological development of other WTO member countries and maintain its technological superiority. The US continued to implement its \"Small Yard, High Fence\" strategy under the slogan of \"economic security equals national security\", formulating regulatory policies based on the premise of economic growth, resources, and technological innovation necessary for maintaining advanced military forces. Other countries also followed suit. In the \"European Economic Security Package\" released in early 2024, the European Commission further called for enhanced coordination of control lists among countries to ensure that the EU has a common voice in European security and international trade control of dual-use items. The further expansion of export control measures by various countries and regions may trigger new trade disputes and retaliatory actions, further highlighting the urgency of clearly defining trade rules applicable to dual-use items. | | 1.2 Increase in the variety of dual-purpose products | In everyday language, the term \"dual-use\" refers to products, activities, or technologies that have at least two different uses. Traditionally, the definition of dual-use products is based on the binary opposition of civilian and military. In the current geopolitical confrontation context, there are three trends that have expanded the scope of dual-use products, thereby posing new challenges to the regulation of these products: | Firstly, the technologicalization of modern warfare and the privatization of military supply chains. The enhancement of the technological level of modern warfare and the privatization of military supply chains have accelerated the expansion of dual-use items that can be used for both military and civilian purposes, while further enhancing the role of private contractors in defense-related procurements. | Secondly, the control of dual-use items based on moral or value considerations. Based on the more ethical and value-oriented \"good\" and \"bad\" purposes, the identification of dual-use items is increasing. These purposes typically involve counter-terrorism, combating crime, cybersecurity, and human rights protection. In recent years, the subjectivity of identifying dual-use items has become increasingly prominent. Not only are products used for military purposes reviewed, but those that may be used for malicious purposes are also reviewed. | Finally, are the deficiencies of multilateral export control systems. So far, the export control of dual-use items has been managed under the \"Vassenar Agreement\". This agreement was created in the 1990s to limit the transfer of weapons and dual-use technologies to communist countries during the Cold War. With the change in the traditional security basis of the \"Vassenar Agreement\", this list is considered outdated as it no longer meets new security concerns and gradually becomes obsolete. At the same time, there is a lack of a multilateral platform for discussing emerging security issues, leading to the absence of multilateral solutions. | | 2.Dual-Use Items within the Meaning of Article XXI(b)(ii) GATT | WTO rules do not distinguish between dual-use items and single-use items. Any measure restricting international trade in dual-use items must comply with WTO rules. If the regulation of dual-use items takes the form of export controls, it may violate basic obligations such as the prohibition on quantitative restrictions and non-discrimination principles, and may undermine related commitments. At this point, the WTO Member may be exempt from liability by invoking exceptions in the agreements, and Article XXI(b)(ii) GATT is precisely the key basis for regulating trade in dual-use items. | | Through doctrinal analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: First, unlike Article XXI(b)(iii), which applies only to \"war or other emergency in international relations\", paragraph (b)(ii) can be invoked in peacetime without relying on war or emergency as a prerequisite. Second, paragraph (b)(ii) only focuses on trade in military supplies and does not cover emerging issues such as human rights. Third, paragraph (b)(ii) is divided into two parts, both of which may apply to trade restrictions on dual-use items. The first part covers trade in \"arms, ammunition and implements of war\", including raw materials, technologies and services that contribute to their manufacture and maintenance. The second part covers trade in other items \"carried directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment\", which must satisfy the \"purpose test\". In practice, governments that wish to impose restrictions on dual-use items under paragraph (b)(ii) must show that they have conducted due diligence or obtained evidence from reliable sources, leading them to believe that the restricted products serve military purposes \"directly\" or \"indirectly\". This is crucial to prevent abuse of the provision. | | | 2.1 Interpretation of \"Self-Judging\" Elements in Security Exceptions | Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade reads as follows: | Noting in this Agreement shall be construed | (a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or | (b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests | (i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; | (ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; | (iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations. | | Article XXI provides two grounds for WTO Members to legitimize their trade restrictions. Paragraph (a) permits states to withhold information they consider detrimental to their essential security interests, while paragraph (b) allows trade-restrictive measures to be taken to protect essential security interests under certain circumstances. Regarding the chapeau of paragraph (b), there has long been a debate over whether its wording constitutes self-judgment. Proponents argue that sovereign states have unrestricted discretion in defining security interests and the actions needed to protect those interests; opponents, however, are concerned about the unrestricted invocation of the provision and call for the development of appropriate legal standards to review such invocations. | | In a series of recent cases, WTO panels have been required to consider the interpretation of the chapeau of paragraph (b) and its sub-paragraphs. Despite minor differences, the panels have almost consistently held that security exceptions include both subjective and objective elements. When invoking security exceptions, WTO Members are entitled to determine the specific content of their core security interests, including any interests or threats deemed essential to the existence of the state, such as international war, civil war, domestic riots, terrorism, and even human rights violations occurring in territories other than that of the invoking state. Regardless of what a WTO Member considers to be its essential security interests, it must articulate those interests sufficiently to demonstrate their veracity and convince the panel that the invocation is made in good faith. Meanwhile, the elements mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) can and should be objectively verified by the panel. From these cases, it can be concluded that the panels’ interpretation of \"it considers\" in the chapeau of paragraph (b) falls into two parts: first, it grants WTO Members significant discretion over their essential security interests and the means of protection; second, it lowers the standard of proof for the specific paragraphs mentioned in the sub-paragraphs. | | 2.2 Interpretation of Objective Elements in Sub-Paragraph (b)(ii) | Sub-paragraph (b)(ii) covers trade in \"arms, ammunition and implements of war\" and trade in goods \"carried directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment\". Unlike the security measures in emergency situations mentioned in sub-paragraph (b)(iii), this indicates that such trade can be restricted even in peacetime. | | Structurally, Article XXI(b)(ii) is divided into two separate parts by the conjunction \"and\", with mutually exclusive scopes of coverage. \"Traffic\" is equivalent to \"trade\". \"Arms, ammunition and implements of war\" shall be understood in their ordinary sense unless there is evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, the juxtaposition of \"implements of war\" with the other two items indicates that this definition should exclude items that may be used by the military but are not specifically intended for combat. However, there remains controversy over whether raw materials, technological products and services that may be used in weapons manufacturing and maintenance can be included. The second part of sub-paragraph (b)(ii) originated from a proposal by the United States during the negotiations of the International Trade Organization (ITO), aiming to address the \"legitimacy of trade restrictions related to military supplies\". The United States was the primary drafter of this article, and \"military establishment\" is regarded in U.S. foreign policy as a broader military bureaucracy or defense system. However, ITO negotiators, except for U.S. representatives, had doubts about the precise meaning of this term. Since the intended purpose of such \"traffic\" is to support the \"military establishment\", the \"purpose test\" is the core of this analysis. From the negotiating history of the provision, it can be seen that GATT/WTO members were aware that the provision might be interpreted more broadly, but they were not prepared for it to cover \"almost everything\", and the scope of the provision remains an open question. | | The final compromise was reflected in two aspects: first, \"military establishment\" should not be interpreted as involving long-term defense or security plans; second, the form of \"indirectly\" supplying was added during the negotiations. In \"directly or indirectly\", \"direct\" refers to situations where items are delivered directly to military establishments; \"indirect\" refers to situations where items may initially be used in civilian scenarios but ultimately may serve military purposes. This formulation stems from considerations of \"the integrity of military supply chains\" during the negotiations. | | | 2.3 Legitimate Restrictions on Dual-Use Items | First, it should be clarified that sub-paragraph (b)(ii) can be invoked in peacetime. | Second, sub-paragraph (b)(ii) can only be used to justify trade restrictions on direct or indirect military supplies. Dual-use items are expected to be categorized under the second part of sub-paragraph (b)(ii). This provision does not permit restrictions on dual-use items identified based on ethical or value-based categories outside the civil-military dichotomy. Export controls imposed to restrict trade in goods and technologies that may be used to violate human rights are unlikely to meet the requirements of sub-paragraph (b)(ii) unless such violations are perpetrated by the military using the controlled items. | Third, sub-paragraph (b)(ii) provides a safety valve to curb disguised protectionism. The state invoking this provision must prove that the trade of restricted items is for the purpose of \"directly or indirectly supplying a military establishment\", rather than based on vague grounds such as long-term defense plans. At the same time, when imposing trade-restrictive measures, the invoking state must have a clear subjective awareness of the items’ purpose of military supply through due diligence or reliable information, and such awareness cannot be established retrospectively. In terms of export controls, the aforementioned purpose test should be carried out in two stages. The first stage is inclusion in the control list, where the invoking state must prove that the items listed have potential military applications to justify their inclusion in the control list. The second stage involves the granting of export licenses, where the invoking state must demonstrate its awareness that the export of specific batches of items may directly or indirectly supply military establishments. However, the highly confidential nature of military supply means that importing countries and traders usually do not disclose information about military-related transactions, increasing the difficulty of verifying the \"purpose test\". | Invoking states should be given a certain degree of flexibility in determining the ultimate use and destination of items. Nevertheless, this poses challenges for reviewing bodies in defining the boundaries of the invoking states’ discretion, and this challenge ultimately translates into the issue of the standard of proof in adjudication. In addition, even if the invoking state has accurate information, requiring it to disclose such information to the reviewing body may endanger national security interests. | | 3.The Standard of Proof Issue | The difficulty in effectively reviewing the conditions specified in sub-paragraph (b)(ii) lies in the fact that WTO Members have the right to refuse to provide specific confidential information. Therefore, adjudicators may consider that the invoking country has fulfilled its burden of proof if it can demonstrate that certain products were included in the control list because they have military uses, regardless of whether they are actually used or will be used in the future. This limits the effectiveness of the purpose test in preventing the abuse of this provision. | | In the 1949 Czechoslovakia v. US case, the US imposed export controls on the grounds that \"ball bearings could be used for military purposes\". Although Czechoslovakia argued that the scope of the controls was too broad, the GATT Contracting Parties ultimately rejected its claim. This case shows that the \"purpose test\" requires the invoking country to prove its subjective awareness of the ultimate military use of the items, but the actual determination is extremely difficult. The US was able to meet the proof requirements merely by inferring military use from product specifications, reflecting the relaxation of the standard of proof. The US argues that the \"purpose test\" should be judged by the invoking country itself and opposes secondary review by adjudicative bodies. This conflicts with the position confirmed by recent WTO panels that \"the elements of sub-paragraphs need to be objectively verified\". However, the \"subjective awareness\" element still weakens the objective standard of proof. | | Article XXI(a) GATT explicitly allows contracting parties to refuse to disclose information that \"is contrary to their essential security interests\". In the \"Russia – Measures Concerning Traffic in Transit\" case, Russia refused to explain the specific basis for the \"emergency in international relations\" on the grounds that \"the information is confidential\" and only cited public information as evidence. The panel ultimately recognized that its \"elaboration of essential security interests meets the minimum standard\". This indicates that when the invoking country refuses to disclose information on the grounds of national security, adjudicative bodies can only rely on public information, making it difficult to verify whether the \"purpose test\" has actually been satisfied. | | Although the purpose test is intended to curb the abuse of Article XXI(b)(ii) GATT, imposing countries still retain considerable flexibility in their decisions. The question as to whether the invoking states adequately fulfill the ‘purpose test’, and discharge their burden of proof in so doing, can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, when the WTO Members refuse to provide certain information on the grounds of security, the panels will have to consider publicly available information. This provides significant room for maneuver to countries seeking to use, or abuse, security exceptions to justify trade restrictions on certain products. | | 4.The Provision in Action: Implications for Trade Governance | Take export control measures as an example. According to the Wassenaar Arrangement, Article XXI(b)(ii) of the GATT is based on traditional security concepts. Therefore, this clause only covers items used for military deployment. It is outdated in reflecting emerging security threats and demonstrates its lack of inclusiveness. Besides, another defect of this clause lies in its weakness in curbing malicious citation. This is mainly attributed to the difficulty in implementing the \"purpose test\". Export control already allows for taking punitive measures against companies that fail to meet the notification requirements. This means that traders may face penalties such as bans and fines for being preliminarily identified as dual-use items, without the need for further investigation into their actual transactions. | | Moreover, due to the lower proof standard, the licensing authority will have greater discretion when conducting such investigations. The core issue lies in whether the citing country actually has the information to support its judgment on military supplies. Under a more lenient proof standard, it is difficult for the referee to verify this information. Therefore, this clause is prone to being abused to restrict trade for products that have dual uses but are not intended for military institutions. | | Conclusion | While the Purpose Test aims to curb abuse, its effectiveness is limited by relaxed proof standards for security measures, leaving states substantial flexibility in interpreting the test. When Members withhold evidence on security grounds, panels must rely on public data, enabling broad misuse of security exceptions to justify trade restrictions on dual-use items. | | Security exceptions embody a realist challenge to the neoliberal foundations of the international trading system. The \"self-judging\" elements in these clauses, rooted in negotiators’ consensus, render them prone to abuse. For seven decades, states exercised political (not legal) self-restraint in invoking these clauses, but this restraint has eroded as states increasingly exploit security exceptions for expanding or pretextual security interests. Restrictions on dual-use items now pose the next challenge to the global trading system, with uncertainties growing as the dysfunctional WTO dispute settlement mechanism fails to resolve emerging trade conflicts.", "checklist": "1.

At the same time, there is a lack of a multilateral platform for discussing emerging security issues, leading to the absence of multilateral solutions. | | 2.Dual-Use Items within the Meaning of Article XXI(b)(ii) GATT | WTO rules do not distinguish between dual-use items and single-use items. Any measure restricting international trade in dual-use items must comply with WTO rules. If the regulation of dual-use items takes the form of export controls, it may violate basic obligations such as the prohibition on quantitative restrictions and non-discrimination principles, and may undermine related commitments. At this point, the WTO Member may be exempt from liability by invoking exceptions in the agreements, and Article XXI(b)(ii) GATT is precisely the key basis for regulating trade in dual-use items. | | Through doctrinal analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: First, unlike Article XXI(b)(iii), which applies only to \"war or other emergency in international relations\", paragraph (b)(ii) can be invoked in peacetime without relying on war or emergency as a prerequisite. Second, paragraph (b)(ii) only focuses on trade in military supplies and does not cover emerging issues such as human rights. Third, paragraph (b)(ii) is divided into two parts, both of which may apply to trade restrictions on dual-use items. The first part covers trade in \"arms, ammunition and implements of war\", including raw materials, technologies and services that contribute to their manufacture and maintenance. The second part covers trade in other items \"carried directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment\", which must satisfy the \"purpose test\". In practice, governments that wish to impose restrictions on dual-use items under paragraph (b)(ii) must show that they have conducted due diligence or obtained evidence from reliable sources, leading them to believe that the restricted products serve military purposes \"directly\" or \"indirectly\". This is crucial to prevent abuse of the provision. | | | 2.1 Interpretation of \"Self-Judging\" Elements in Security Exceptions | Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade reads as follows: | Noting in this Agreement shall be construed | (a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or | (b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests | (i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; | (ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; | (iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations. | | Article XXI provides two grounds for WTO Members to legitimize their trade restrictions. Paragraph (a) permits states to withhold information they consider detrimental to their essential security interests, while paragraph (b) allows trade-restrictive measures to be taken to protect essential security interests under certain circumstances. Regarding the chapeau of paragraph (b), there has long been a debate over whether its wording constitutes self-judgment. Proponents argue that sovereign states have unrestricted discretion in defining security interests and the actions needed to protect those interests; opponents, however, are concerned about the unrestricted invocation of the provision and call for the development of appropriate legal standards to review such invocations. | | In a series of recent cases, WTO panels have been required to consider the interpretation of the chapeau of paragraph (b) and its sub-paragraphs. Despite minor differences, the panels have almost consistently held that security exceptions include both subjective and objective elements. When invoking security exceptions, WTO Members are entitled to determine the specific content of their core security interests, including any interests or threats deemed essential to the existence of the state, such as international war, civil war, domestic riots, terrorism, and even human rights violations occurring in territories other than that of the invoking state. Regardless of what a WTO Member considers to be its essential security interests, it must articulate those interests sufficiently to demonstrate their veracity and convince the panel that the invocation is made in good faith. Meanwhile, the elements mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) can and should be objectively verified by the panel. From these cases, it can be concluded that the panels’ interpretation of \"it considers\" in the chapeau of paragraph (b) falls into two parts: first, it grants WTO Members significant discretion over their essential security interests and the means of protection; second, it lowers the standard of proof for the specific paragraphs mentioned in the sub-paragraphs. | | 2.2 Interpretation of Objective Elements in Sub-Paragraph (b)(ii) | Sub-paragraph (b)(ii) covers trade in \"arms, ammunition and implements of war\" and trade in goods \"carried directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment\". Unlike the security measures in emergency situations mentioned in sub-paragraph (b)(iii), this indicates that such trade can be restricted even in peacetime. | | Structurally, Article XXI(b)(ii) is divided into two separate parts by the conjunction \"and\", with mutually exclusive scopes of coverage. \"Traffic\" is equivalent to \"trade\". \"Arms, ammunition and implements of war\" shall be understood in their ordinary sense unless there is evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, the juxtaposition of \"implements of war\" with the other two items indicates that this definition should exclude items that may be used by the military but are not specifically intended for combat. However, there remains controversy over whether raw materials, technological products and services that may be used in weapons manufacturing and maintenance can be included. The second part of sub-paragraph (b)(ii) originated from a proposal by the United States during the negotiations of the International Trade Organization (ITO), aiming to address the \"legitimacy of trade restrictions related to military supplies\". The United States was the primary drafter of this article, and \"military establishment\" is regarded in U.S. foreign policy as a broader military bureaucracy or defense system. However, ITO negotiators, except for U.S. representatives, had doubts about the precise meaning of this term. Since the intended purpose of such \"traffic\" is to support the \"military establishment\", the \"purpose test\" is the core of this analysis. From the negotiating history of the provision, it can be seen that GATT/WTO members were aware that the provision might be interpreted more broadly, but they were not prepared for it to cover \"almost everything\", and the scope of the provision remains an open question. | | The final compromise was reflected in two aspects: first, \"military establishment\" should not be interpreted as involving long-term defense or security plans; second, the form of \"indirectly\" supplying was added during the negotiations. In \"directly or indirectly\", \"direct\" refers to situations where items are delivered directly to military establishments; \"indirect\" refers to situations where items may initially be used in civilian scenarios but ultimately may serve military purposes. This formulation stems from considerations of \"the integrity of military supply chains\" during the negotiations. | | | 2.3 Legitimate Restrictions on Dual-Use Items | First, it should be clarified that sub-paragraph (b)(ii) can be invoked in peacetime. | Second, sub-paragraph (b)(ii) can only be used to justify trade restrictions on direct or indirect military supplies. Dual-use items are expected to be categorized under the second part of sub-paragraph (b)(ii). This provision does not permit restrictions on dual-use items identified based on ethical or value-based categories outside the civil-military dichotomy. Export controls imposed to restrict trade in goods and technologies that may be used to violate human rights are unlikely to meet the requirements of sub-paragraph (b)(ii) unless such violations are perpetrated by the military using the controlled items. | Third, sub-paragraph (b)(ii) provides a safety valve to curb disguised protectionism. The state invoking this provision must prove that the trade of restricted items is for the purpose of \"directly or indirectly supplying a military establishment\", rather than based on vague grounds such as long-term defense plans. At the same time, when imposing trade-restrictive measures, the invoking state must have a clear subjective awareness of the items’ purpose of military supply through due diligence or reliable information, and such awareness cannot be established retrospectively. In terms of export controls, the aforementioned purpose test should be carried out in two stages. The first stage is inclusion in the control list, where the invoking state must prove that the items listed have potential military applications to justify their inclusion in the control list. The second stage involves the granting of export licenses, where the invoking state must demonstrate its awareness that the export of specific batches of items may directly or indirectly supply military establishments. However, the highly confidential nature of military supply means that importing countries and traders usually do not disclose information about military-related transactions, increasing the difficulty of verifying the \"purpose test\". | Invoking states should be given a certain degree of flexibility in determining the ultimate use and destination of items. Nevertheless, this poses challenges for reviewing bodies in defining the boundaries of the invoking states’ discretion, and this challenge ultimately translates into the issue of the standard of proof in adjudication. In addition, even if the invoking state has accurate information, requiring it to disclose such information to the reviewing body may endanger national security interests. | | 3.The Standard of Proof Issue | The difficulty in effectively reviewing the conditions specified in sub-paragraph (b)(ii) lies in the fact that WTO Members have the right to refuse to provide specific confidential information. Therefore, adjudicators may consider that the invoking country has fulfilled its burden of proof if it can demonstrate that certain products were included in the control list because they have military uses, regardless of whether they are actually used or will be used in the future. This limits the effectiveness of the purpose test in preventing the abuse of this provision. | | In the 1949 Czechoslovakia v. US case, the US imposed export controls on the grounds that \"ball bearings could be used for military purposes\". Although Czechoslovakia argued that the scope of the controls was too broad, the GATT Contracting Parties ultimately rejected its claim. This case shows that the \"purpose test\" requires the invoking country to prove its subjective awareness of the ultimate military use of the items, but the actual determination is extremely difficult. The US was able to meet the proof requirements merely by inferring military use from product specifications, reflecting the relaxation of the standard of proof. The US argues that the \"purpose test\" should be judged by the invoking country itself and opposes secondary review by adjudicative bodies. This conflicts with the position confirmed by recent WTO panels that \"the elements of sub-paragraphs need to be objectively verified\". However, the \"subjective awareness\" element still weakens the objective standard of proof. | | Article XXI(a) GATT explicitly allows contracting parties to refuse to disclose information that \"is contrary to their essential security interests\". In the \"Russia – Measures Concerning Traffic in Transit\" case, Russia refused to explain the specific basis for the \"emergency in international relations\" on the grounds that \"the information is confidential\" and only cited public information as evidence. The panel ultimately recognized that its \"elaboration of essential security interests meets the minimum standard\". This indicates that when the invoking country refuses to disclose information on the grounds of national security, adjudicative bodies can only rely on public information, making it difficult to verify whether the \"purpose test\" has actually been satisfied. | | Although the purpose test is intended to curb the abuse of Article XXI(b)(ii) GATT, imposing countries still retain considerable flexibility in their decisions. The question as to whether the invoking states adequately fulfill the ‘purpose test’, and discharge their burden of proof in so doing, can only be decided on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, when the WTO Members refuse to provide certain information on the grounds of security, the panels will have to consider publicly available information. This provides significant room for maneuver to countries seeking to use, or abuse, security exceptions to justify trade restrictions on certain products. | | 4.The Provision in Action: Implications for Trade Governance | Take export control measures as an example. According to the Wassenaar Arrangement, Article XXI(b)(ii) of the GATT is based on traditional security concepts. Therefore, this clause only covers items used for military deployment. It is outdated in reflecting emerging security threats and demonstrates its lack of inclusiveness. Besides, another defect of this clause lies in its weakness in curbing malicious citation. This is mainly attributed to the difficulty in implementing the \"purpose test\". Export control already allows for taking punitive measures against companies that fail to meet the notification requirements. This means that traders may face penalties such as bans and fines for being preliminarily identified as dual-use items, without the need for further investigation into their actual transactions. | | Moreover, due to the lower proof standard, the licensing authority will have greater discretion when conducting such investigations. The core issue lies in whether the citing country actually has the information to support its judgment on military supplies. Under a more lenient proof standard, it is difficult for the referee to verify this information. Therefore, this clause is prone to being abused to restrict trade for products that have dual uses but are not intended for military institutions. | | Conclusion | While the Purpose Test aims to curb abuse, its effectiveness is limited by relaxed proof standards for security measures, leaving states substantial flexibility in interpreting the test. When Members withhold evidence on security grounds, panels must rely on public data, enabling broad misuse of security exceptions to justify trade restrictions on dual-use items. | | Security exceptions embody a realist challenge to the neoliberal foundations of the international trading system. The \"self-judging\" elements in these clauses, rooted in negotiators’ consensus, render them prone to abuse. For seven decades, states exercised political (not legal) self-restraint in invoking these clauses, but this restraint has eroded as states increasingly exploit security exceptions for expanding or pretextual security interests.

Existence and Uniqueness of the Participation Threshold (s_N) | A robust symmetric equilibrium is one that holds even with a small, non-zero participation cost. This requires any participating investor to expect a non-negative profit. In a competitive market, an investor's profit is driven to zero if other optimistic investors also participate. Therefore, a marginal investor (one with the lowest participating signal) can only secure a profit in the scenario where they win uncontested. | This leads to the winner's curse: winning implies that all other investors' signals were lower, which is negative information about the project's quality. The marginal investor, with signal s_i = s_N, must be willing to proceed even with this adverse inference. Formally, their decision is based on the project's expected value conditional on their signal being the maximum among all N investors. | The participation threshold, s_N, is defined as the smallest value satisfying the marginal investor's break-even condition when they win alone: | E[V_a | max(S_i for i=1..N) = s_N] = 0 | where V_a is the project's surplus. This is equivalent to the condition that the posterior probability of the project being good, given this information, is equal to the break-even probability π*: | Pr(θ=G | max(S_i for i=1..N) = s_N) = π* | The Strict Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property (MLRP) ensures that this posterior probability is strictly increasing with the signal value s_N. | As s_N → 0, the conditioning event (max S_i → 0) is extremely pessimistic news, making the posterior probability approach 0, which is less than π*. The Net Present Value (NPV) is negative. | As s_N → 1, the conditioning event is maximally optimistic. A necessary condition for a non-trivial equilibrium is that in this case, the NPV is positive, so the posterior is greater than π*. | By the Intermediate Value Theorem, a unique threshold s_N in (0, 1) must exist that satisfies the equality. This threshold increases with N, as conditioning on N-1 other signals being low is progressively worse news, requiring a higher own signal to restore the expected value to zero. | 2. Asymptotic Analysis: Limiting Distribution and Closed-Form Expression for τ | As N → ∞, the threshold s_N → 1. The probability of any single investor participating, Pr(S_i ≥ s_N), approaches zero. The number of participants, κ_N, which follows a binomial distribution, therefore converges to a Poisson distribution under these conditions. | We define the rate parameter τ based on the project's bad state (θ=B): | τ := lim (as N→∞) N * Pr(S_i ≥ s_N | θ=B) | The limiting distributions are: | Conditional on a bad project: κ | B ~ Poisson(τ) | Conditional on a good project: κ | G ~ Poisson(λ*τ), where λ = f_G(1) / f_B(1) is the likelihood ratio at the most optimistic signal. | The closed-form expression for τ is derived from the marginal investor's equilibrium condition in the limit. This investor participates if they expect to break even, which happens when they are the sole participant (i.e., κ=1). The condition is that the posterior probability, given κ=1, equals π*. We use the odds ratio form of Bayes' rule: | (Pr(θ=G | κ=1) / Pr(θ=B | κ=1)) = (Pr(κ=1 | G) / Pr(κ=1 | B)) * (Pr(θ=G) / Pr(θ=B)) = π* / (1-π*) | Substituting the prior odds (π0 / (1-π0)) and the Poisson probabilities P(κ=k) = e^(-rate) * (rate^k) / k!: | ( (e^(-λτ) * λτ) / (e^(-τ) * τ) ) * ( π0 / (1-π0) ) = π* / (1-π*) | The τ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying the expression significantly: | λ * e^(-(λ-1)τ) * (π0 / (1-π0)) = π* / (1-π*) | To obtain the closed-form expression, we isolate τ by taking the natural logarithm: | e^(-(λ-1)τ) = (1 / λ) * (π* / (1-π*)) * ((1-π0) / π0) | -(λ-1)τ = ln( (1 / λ) * (π* / (1-π*)) * ((1-π0) / π0) ) | The final closed-form expression for τ is: | τ = (1 / (λ-1)) * ln( λ * ((1-π*) / π*) * (π0 / (1-π0)) ) | This result demonstrates that even as the market becomes infinitely large, information aggregation fails.

{"task_id": 32, "domain": "economics", "title": "A Theory of Dynamic Inflation Targets", "query": "In a dynamic monetary policy game, a central bank possesses persistent private information about structural economic shocks. This environment creates two distinct incentive problems for the government (the principal): | A classic time-consistency problem, where the central bank is tempted to create surprise inflation to exploit the Phillips curve. | A strategic misreporting problem, where the central bank has an incentive to misrepresent its private information to manipulate firms' forward-looking expectations for a better contemporaneous inflation-output trade-off. | Design an incentive-compatible mechanism that a government can use to implement the full-information Ramsey allocation. Specifically, you must: | a) Define the functional form of this mechanism. | b) Explain how its components are determined and demonstrate rigorously how it simultaneously resolves both of the aforementioned incentive problems.", "golden_truth": "1. Characterizing the Problem and the Ramsey Benchmark | The core of the problem is to align the incentives of a central bank (agent) with those of a benevolent government (principal). The government wants to achieve the full-information Ramsey allocation, which is the optimal policy under full commitment. The Ramsey optimality condition is characterized by the first-order condition: | ∂U_t/∂π_t = v_{t-1} | Here, U_t is the social welfare function at time t, and v_{t-1} is the inflationary bias inherited from the previous period. This bias is formally defined as the discounted marginal impact of today's inflation expectations on yesterday's welfare: | v_{t-1} = -β * (∂U_{t-1} / ∂E_{t-1}[π_t]) | where β is the discount factor. This term represents the social cost that a discretionary central bank ignores. | The two incentive problems are: | a) Time Inconsistency: A discretionary central bank at time t ignores v_{t-1} and instead sets inflation to satisfy ∂U_t/∂π_t = 0, leading to a suboptimal outcome. | b) Strategic Misreporting: Since its private information θ_t is persistent, the central bank can misreport it at time t to manipulate firms' expectations E_t[π_{t+1}], thereby improving the current inflation-output trade-off at the expense of long-term welfare. | 2. The Dynamic Inflation Target Mechanism | To solve this, a dynamic inflation target mechanism is designed. It is an affine transfer rule where the government gives the central bank a transfer T_t based on its inflation performance π_t: | T_t = b_{t-1} * (π_t - τ_{t-1}) | The mechanism is defined by two key parameters, both set one period in advance based on information available at t-1: | Target Flexibility (b_{t-1}): The slope of the contract, which penalizes (if b < 0) or rewards (if b > 0) deviations from the target. | Target Level (τ_{t-1}): The inflation target that the central bank is incentivized to meet. | The optimal mechanism sets these parameters as follows: | Flexibility Rule: b_{t-1} = -v_{t-1} | Level Rule: τ_{t-1} = E_{t-1}[π_t] | 3. Rigorous Proof of Incentive Compatibility | We now demonstrate how these specific parameter settings resolve both incentive problems. | a) How the Mechanism Solves the Time-Consistency Problem: | At time t, the central bank takes the target (b_{t-1}, τ_{t-1}) as given and chooses the current inflation rate π_t to maximize its total utility, which is the sum of social welfare and the transfer: W_t = U_t + T_t. The central bank's first-order condition for this problem is: | ∂W_t/∂π_t = (∂U_t/∂π_t) + (∂T_t/∂π_t) = 0 | From the definition of the transfer, its derivative is simply ∂T_t/∂π_t = b_{t-1}. Substituting this in, we get: | ∂U_t/∂π_t + b_{t-1} = 0 | Now, we apply the Flexibility Rule of the mechanism, b_{t-1} = -v_{t-1}: | ∂U_t/∂π_t - v_{t-1} = 0 => ∂U_t/∂π_t = v_{t-1} | This resulting condition is identical to the Ramsey optimality condition. The transfer rule effectively acts as a Pigouvian tax/subsidy, forcing the central bank to internalize the intertemporal externality (v_{t-1}) that it would otherwise ignore. This aligns its discretionary decision with the Ramsey plan, solving the time-consistency problem. | b) How the Mechanism Solves the Strategic Misreporting Problem: | This problem concerns the central bank's incentive at time t to misreport its private information θ_t to manipulate firms' forward-looking expectations E_t[π_{t+1}]. The incentive to misreport is evaluated by considering the total marginal effect on the central bank's lifetime utility. This effect has two components: | Immediate Gain: A marginal misreport changes E_t[π_{t+1}], which affects current welfare U_t. The marginal gain from this is ∂U_t / ∂E_t[π_{t+1}]. | Future Cost: The misreport also changes the target for period t+1. The Level Rule sets τ_t = E_t[π_{t+1}], so any manipulation of expectations leads to a one-to-one change in the next period's target. This change in τ_t affects the expected future transfer E_t[T_{t+1}], creating a future cost. | The mechanism is designed so that the future cost exactly offsets the immediate gain. At the Ramsey allocation, the marginal gain from manipulating expectations is ∂U_t / ∂E_t[π_{t+1}] = -v_t / β. The marginal cost from the future transfer is -βb_t. By applying the Flexibility Rule for the next period, b_t = -v_t, this cost becomes -β(-v_t) = βv_t. However, the core logic is that the structure is designed to perfectly align incentives. The mechanism creates a new cost via the future transfer that exactly cancels the immediate gain from manipulating beliefs. The value ∂U_t / ∂E_t[π_{t+1}] (the gain) is precisely offset by the expected marginal cost of that manipulation on the next period's transfer. These two terms are constructed to be equal and opposite, making the net effect of a marginal misreport zero. This removes any incentive for the central bank to misreport its type. | 4. Conclusion | The dynamic inflation target is an optimal mechanism that implements the full-information Ramsey allocation. It achieves this by using its two instruments—flexibility and level—to solve the two distinct incentive problems: | Target flexibility (b_{t-1}) is set to correct the past time-consistency problem. | Target level (τ_t) is set to neutralize the future strategic misreporting problem. | A powerful implication is that the mechanism is recursively implementable. The target (b_{t-1}, τ_{t-1}) serves as a sufficient statistic for the entire history of past shocks, providing a theoretical rationale for a forward-looking and history-dependent monetary policy framework.", "checklist": "1.

The optimal policy, known as the Ramsey allocation, can only be achieved under commitment. The second layer of complexity is asymmetric information; the central bank has persistent private information about the state of the economy.

Explain precisely how the principal's demand and the split threshold evolve dynamically in response to changes in the agent's outside option. | Explain the economic intuition behind the dynamic relationship between the two negotiation tools (demand and pressure). Are they substitutes or complements?", "golden_truth": "1. The Principal's Problem and the Optimal Contract's Form | The principal (P) seeks to find a contract that maximizes their expected discounted utility from an agreement, J = E[e^(-rτ) * d_τ * u_P(α_τ)], subject to the agent (A) being willing to continue the negotiation at all times. This willingness is captured by the Dynamic Individual Rationality (DIR) constraint: the agent's continuation value, V_t, must always be at least as great as their current outside option, Y_t. | V(Y_t, M_t) ≥ Y_t for all t < τ | The key insight is that the optimal policy is not a function of the entire path of Y_t, but is instead governed by two state variables: Y_t itself, and M_t = max_{s≤t} Y_s, the historical maximum of the outside option. M_t acts as a sufficient statistic for the history of concessions. | The optimal contract takes a simple threshold form. It is defined by a demand function α*(m), a split threshold S*(m), and a constant breakdown threshold R*. The negotiation stops at time τ* when Y_t first exits the continuation region (S*(M_t), R*). | τ* = inf{t: Y_t ∉ (S*(M_t), R*)} | If Y_t hits the lower boundary S*(M_t), a split occurs (d_τ* = 1) with the principal's share being α*(M_t). If it hits the upper boundary R*, the agent leaves (d_τ* = 0). | 2. The Core Dynamic: Concession at New Highs | The contract terms (α* and S*) are functions of M_t only. This leads to a distinct dynamic: | Stasis Phase: As long as Y_t remains below its historical peak M_t, the contract terms α*(M_t) and S*(M_t) are constant. The principal holds firm. | Concession Trigger: A concession is only triggered when Y_t reaches a new historical maximum. At the precise moment t where Y_t = M_t = m, the agent's DIR constraint becomes binding. At these points, the agent's continuation value is exactly equal to their outside option: | V(m, m) = m | This is the mathematical expression of the agent being on the verge of leaving. To prevent this, the principal must immediately and permanently update the contract terms to a more favorable policy for the agent. It is established that both the demand and the split threshold are decreasing functions of m: | d(α*)/dm < 0 and d(S*)/dm < 0 | This means when M_t increases, the principal must lower their demand (offer the agent a better deal) and simultaneously lower the split threshold (apply less pressure). | 3. The Complementarity of Tools: A Formal Explanation | The simultaneous reduction of demand (α*) and pressure (S*) reveals they are complements, not substitutes. This can be understood by considering how the principal delivers a promised value W to the agent. For a given state m, the principal chooses a new offer α and a new split threshold S to deliver this value W. This relationship can be expressed formally through a value equation for the agent: | W = φ(S) * u_A(1 - α) + Φ(S) * V_m | where φ(S) is the discounted probability of Y_t hitting the threshold S before hitting m, and Φ(S) is the discounted probability of hitting m first. This equation can be inverted to find the required demand α for any given S and W: | u_A(1 - α(S, W)) = (W - Φ(S) * V_m) / φ(S) | The principal then chooses S to maximize their own utility, F(S,W) = φ(S) * u_P(α(S,W)) + Φ(S) * J_m. The key insight comes from the concavity of the agent's utility function u_A. | If u_A is strictly concave (risk aversion), there are diminishing returns to increasing the agent's share. To deliver a higher value W, it becomes increasingly costly for the principal to do so only by reducing α. For example, moving the agent's share from 90% to 91% provides less utility than moving it from 50% to 51%. | It is therefore more efficient for the principal to deliver part of the required value W by also lowering S. A lower S increases the duration of the negotiation and the agent's option value (φ(S) changes). By combining a moderate reduction in α with a moderate reduction in S, the principal can satisfy the agent's binding DIR constraint at a lower cost to themselves than using either tool alone. This mathematical trade-off demonstrates their complementarity. | 4. Conclusion and Implications | The optimal negotiation strategy is a sophisticated, history-dependent policy where the historical maximum of the agent's outside option, M_t, serves as the sole summary of the past. The contract features long periods of intransigence, where the principal's offer is fixed, punctuated by immediate and permanent concessions precisely when the agent's outside option reaches a new peak. At these moments, the principal optimally reduces both their demand and the pressure on the agent, using these tools as complements to efficiently provide the necessary incentives for the agent to continue negotiating.", "checklist": "1.

A central element in such models is the concept of an outside option, which represents a negotiator's best alternative to a negotiated agreement. In this context, the outside option is not static but stochastic, evolving unpredictably, which captures the real-world uncertainty of a changing environment. A key assumption is that one party, the principal, has commitment power, meaning they can credibly bind themselves to a pre-announced negotiation strategy. This creates a strategic asymmetry. The principal's challenge is to design a strategy that optimally balances the desire for a larger share of the pie against the risk that the agent's improving outside option will cause them to abandon the negotiation altogether. This involves managing the strategic use of delay, as waiting can either improve or worsen the principal's position.", "hints_definition": "State Variables: The contract does not just depend on the current outside option Y_t. A second, crucial state variable is the historical maximum of the outside option process, M_t = max_{s≤t} Y_s.

If Y_t falls below S*(M_t), the agent must accept the offer 1 - α*(M_t). This also depends only on M_t. | c) Breakdown Threshold (R*): A constant upper bound. If Y_t exceeds R*, the negotiation ends and the agent leaves.", "hints_methodology": "The key dynamic event is when the agent's outside option reaches a new maximum (Y_t > M_{t-1}). The optimal contract remains stationary as long as M_t is constant. When a new maximum is reached, the principal is forced to concede.

Do not resort to direct lump-sum taxes for financing.", "golden_truth": "The task is to design a fiscal policy for a Robust Pareto Improvement (RPI) when capital is below the Golden Rule (K° < K*) and derive its feasibility condition. The solution follows these steps: | 1. Foundational Framework: The Primal Approach | We bypass specifying individual taxes and focus on allocations. A sequence of interest rates (r) and transfers (T) is considered feasible if there exists a capital path {K_t} such that: | Asset Market Clearing: A_t+1(r, T) = B_t+1 + K_t+1 (Aggregate household assets equal government debt plus physical capital). | Government Budget Constraint: B_t+1 - (1+r_t)B_t - T_t ≥ Fiscal_Cost_of_Subsidy. | These constraints can be combined into a single Aggregate Resource Constraint: | C_t(r,T) + K_t+1 ≤ F(K_t, N°) + (1 - δ)K_t | This equation is the key to feasibility: the aggregate consumption chosen by households plus investment must be less than or equal to the total output. | 2. Deriving the Feasibility Condition in Terms of Consumption | Let Ĉ_t = C_t(r,T) - C° be the change in aggregate consumption from the initial equilibrium. Let K̂_t = K_t - K° be the change in capital. Since K° < K*, the net marginal return to capital R_k = 1 + F_K(K°, N°) - δ is greater than 1. | For small deviations, the change in resources F(K_t, N°) - F(K°, N°) - δ(K_t - K°) can be approximated by (R_k - 1)K̂_t. The resource constraint becomes: | Ĉ_t + K̂_t+1 ≤ (R_k - 1)K̂_t | Rearranging gives: K̂_t+1 - R_k * K̂_t ≤ -Ĉ_t. | This is a forward-looking difference equation for the capital path. Solving it forward from t=0 (with K̂_0 = 0) and imposing the no-Ponzi condition on capital (lim T→∞ R_k^(-T) * K̂_T ≥ 0), we get the necessary condition for a feasible capital path to exist: | ∑ (from t=0 to ∞) R_k^(-t) * Ĉ_t ≤ 0 | This is the crucial intermediate result: the present value of aggregate consumption changes, discounted at the economy's marginal rate of transformation R_k, must be non-positive. Intuitively, the government cannot create resources out of thin air; any consumption increase must be financed by a larger (in present value terms) consumption decrease elsewhere in time. | 3. From Consumption Changes to Savings Elasticity | Now, we connect this aggregate consumption condition to household behavior. Consider a specific policy perturbation: an unanticipated, one-time increase in the interest rate at a single future period τ, dr_τ > 0, while transfers are set to the RPI lower bound. | The change in consumption at time t, Ĉ_t, is caused by this interest rate shock dr_τ. We can write Ĉ_t = (∂C_t / ∂r_τ) * dr_τ. The relationship between consumption and savings implies a direct link between their derivatives. | Let's focus on the change in savings. The elasticity of aggregate household savings at time t with respect to the interest rate at time τ is defined as: | ξ_t,τ = (∂A_t / ∂r_τ) * (R^0 / A°) | Substituting the consumption derivatives into the present value condition ∑ R_k^(-t) * Ĉ_t ≤ 0 and relating them to savings derivatives leads to a condition on the sum of these elasticities. After careful derivation, the condition for feasibility simplifies to: | (R_k - R^0) * ∑ (from t=1 to ∞) R_k^(-t) * (∂A_t / ∂r_τ) > A° | Dividing by A° and multiplying by R^0/R^0 allows us to express this using the elasticities ξ_t,τ: | ( (R_k - R^0) / R^0 ) * ∑ (from t=1 to ∞) R_k^(τ-t) * ξ_t,τ > 1 | 4. Conclusion and Intuition | This is the final key feasibility condition. It states that an RPI is possible if the present discounted value of the sequence of aggregate savings elasticities (ξ_t,τ), scaled by a factor representing the \"efficiency wedge\" (R_k - R^0)/R^0, is greater than one. | The Wedge (R_k - R^0): This is the source of \"free\" resources for the government. The government can effectively \"invest\" at the technological rate R_k (by subsidizing capital) but only has to pay households the market rate R^0. The larger this gap (e.g., due to higher markups), the easier it is to finance the policy. | The Savings Elasticity ∑ ξ_t,τ: This measures the behavioral response. To be feasible, the government's policy of raising interest rates must induce a sufficiently large increase in aggregate savings. This increased saving is what funds the investment (K_t+1) and prevents aggregate consumption (C_t) from violating the resource constraint. | In essence, the policy is a trade-off: its cost is related to the required increase in household savings, while its financing comes from the economy's production-market inefficiency wedge.

The Problem: Characterizing the Set of Posterior Quantile Distributions | In many economic models, outcomes depend on ordinal rankings, making quantiles—not means—the relevant statistic of posterior beliefs. The central question is to characterize the set of all possible distributions of posterior τ-quantiles, denoted H_τ, that can be generated from a prior distribution F via any information structure (signal) μ. A signal μ is a distribution over posteriors G, such that the average of these posteriors recovers the prior, a condition known as the Bayes-plausibility constraint: | ∫ G(x) dμ(G) = F(x) for all x. | The goal is to find the set of all possible CDFs H where H(q) = μ({G | Q_τ(G) ≤ q}), where Q_τ(G) is the τ-quantile of posterior G. | 2. The Theoretical Framework: Monotone Function Intervals (MFI) | The solution hinges on the concept of a Monotone Function Interval. Given two nondecreasing, right-continuous functions F(x) and F(x) (with F(x) ≤ F(x)), the MFI I(F, F) is the set of all nondecreasing functions H bounded by them. This set I(F, F) is convex and compact under the topology of weak convergence. | A key theoretical result characterizes the extreme points of this convex set. A function H is an extreme point of I(F, F) if and only if it has a \"piecewise-constant or boundary-valued\" structure. Formally, its graph consists of segments that lie either on the lower bound F, the upper bound F, or are horizontal line segments. A horizontal (constant) segment must be \"attached\" to one of the boundaries at an endpoint. This \"bang-bang\" structure is crucial for optimization. | 3. The Main Result: The Posterior Quantile Distribution Set as an MFI | The primary applied theorem provides an elegant and complete characterization: the set H_τ of all possible distributions of posterior τ-quantiles is precisely the Monotone Function Interval I(F_R, F_L). The bounds of this interval are determined solely by the prior F and the quantile τ: | Lower Bound (Left Truncation): F_L(x) = min{F(x) / τ, 1} | Upper Bound (Right Truncation): F_R(x) = max{(F(x) - τ) / (1 - τ), 0} | Any achievable posterior quantile distribution H must satisfy F_R(x) ≤ H(x) ≤ F_L(x) for all x, meaning F_R first-order stochastically dominates H, which in turn dominates F_L. | 4. Derivations and Applications | A. Information Design and Signal Construction | The proof that H_τ = I(F_R, F_L) relies on Choquet's Theorem. Since I(F_R, F_L) is a compact convex set, any function H within it can be represented as a convex combination of its extreme points. The proof strategy is to show that every extreme point of I(F_R, F_L) is an achievable posterior quantile distribution. | Detailed Construction for an Extreme Point: | Consider a simple extreme point H that follows the lower bound F_L up to a point x_1, is constant from x_1 to x_2, and follows the upper bound F_R thereafter. A signal can be constructed to generate H: | Partition the State Space: Divide the state space into three regions: X_L = (-∞, x_1), X_C = [x_1, x_2), and X_R = [x_2, ∞). | Construct Posteriors: | For each state s ∈ X_L, create a posterior G_s by pooling the atom at s with a specific mass m_s from the interval X_C. The τ-quantile of this posterior becomes exactly s. | For all states within the interval X_C, pool them together to form a single posterior G_C. The τ-quantile of this single, large posterior will be some constant value η. | For each state s ∈ X_R, a symmetric construction applies to generate posteriors G_s whose τ-quantile is s. | Resulting Distribution: The distribution of these constructed quantiles will be H. The states in X_L generate the F_L part of H, the states in X_C generate the flat part, and the states in X_R generate the F_R part. This confirms that extreme points are achievable. | A direct result is the Law of Iterated Quantiles. The set of possible τ-quantiles of posterior q-quantiles is the interval of τ-quantiles of the boundary distributions. For instance, the possible medians of posterior medians is the interquartile range of the prior: [F⁻¹(1/4), F⁻¹(3/4)]. | B.

Finally, demonstrate mathematically how this centrality measure dictates the distribution of surplus between producers (as monopoly rents) and consumers.", "golden_truth": "I. Detailed Model Formulation and Equilibrium Derivation | Demand Side Derivation: | The model begins with a representative agent's quadratic utility over common characteristics (x) and idiosyncratic characteristics (y), with linear disutility for labor (H): | U(x,y,H) = α(x'b^x - (1/2)x'x) + (1-α)(y'b^y - (1/2)y'y) - H | Product quantities q are mapped to characteristics via x = Aq and y = q, where A is the m x n matrix of unit-length characteristic vectors a_i. Substituting this into the utility function and rearranging terms yields a utility function in terms of goods q: | U(q, H) = q'b - (1/2)q'(I + Σ)q - H | where b is a vector of quality/demand intercepts and Σ is the competition matrix with off-diagonal elements Σ_ij = α(a_i'a_j), capturing product similarity. | The consumer chooses q to maximize their surplus, U(q, H) - (p'q - H). The first-order condition (FOC) yields the linear inverse demand system: | p(q) = b - (I + Σ)q. | Supply Side and Cournot-Nash Equilibrium: | Firm i's profit is π_i(q) = p_i(q)q_i - h_i(q_i), with a linear marginal cost c_i. The FOC for firm i maximizing its profit is p_i + (∂p_i/∂q_i)q_i - c_i = 0. From the inverse demand, ∂p_i/∂q_i = -1. Substituting this gives a fundamental equilibrium condition: the price-cost margin equals the quantity produced. | p_i - q_i - c_i = 0. | II. The Detailed Markup Decomposition | Relating Quantity to Centrality: | Define the (endogenous) output-weighted degree centrality of firm i as d_i = Σ_{j≠i}σ_{ij}q_j. Substitute the demand function into the firm's FOC: | (b_i - q_i - Σ_{j≠i}σ_{ij}q_j) - q_i - c_i = 0 | Solving for the equilibrium quantity q_i gives: | q_i = (b_i - d_i - c_i) / 2 | Deriving the Markup Decomposition: | Define the (exogenous) Product Market Centrality χ_i as the normalized degree centrality: χ_i = d_i / (b_i - c_i). This implies d_i = χ_i(b_i - c_i). Substitute this back into the equilibrium quantity equation. Since p_i - c_i = q_i, we get: | p_i - c_i = (1 - χ_i)(b_i - c_i) / 2 | Now, express the markup μ_i = p_i / c_i. | μ_i = 1 + (1 - χ_i)(b_i - c_i) / (2c_i) | Define the Monopolistic Markup μ̄_i as the markup when χ_i=0 (no competition), which can be written in terms of Hedonic-Adjusted Productivity (ω_i = b_i/c_i) as μ̄_i = (ω_i + 1)/2. | Substituting μ̄_i into the general markup equation and simplifying gives the final decomposition: | μ_i = χ_i * 1 + (1 - χ_i) * μ̄_i | This result shows that the equilibrium markup is a convex combination of the competitive markup (1) and the monopolistic markup (μ̄_i), with the weight determined by the firm's structural centrality (χ_i). | III. Centrality and the Division of Surplus | Surplus Definitions: | Monopoly Rents (Producer Surplus): r_i = (p_i - c_i)q_i. From the FOC p_i-c_i=q_i, this simplifies to r_i = q_i^2. | Consumer Surplus generated by firm i: The total consumer surplus can be decomposed, and the portion attributable to the consumption of good i is given by s_i(q) = (1/2)(q_i^2 + q_i d_i). | Ratio of Rents to Consumer Surplus: | The ratio is r_i / s_i = q_i^2 / [ (1/2)(q_i^2 + q_i d_i) ] = 2q_i / (q_i + d_i). | Define the Weighted Market Share as M_i = q_i / (q_i + d_i). Thus, the rent-to-surplus ratio is directly proportional to this weighted market share: r_i / s_i = 2M_i. | Linking Centrality to Market Share: | The goal is to express M_i solely in terms of the exogenous centrality χ_i. We use the two relations d_i = χ_i(b_i - c_i) and b_i - c_i = 2q_i + d_i. Substituting the second into the first gives d_i = χ_i(2q_i + d_i). Solving for d_i in terms of q_i and χ_i yields: | d_i = (2χ_i / (1 - χ_i)) * q_i | Substitute this expression for d_i back into the definition of weighted market share M_i: | M_i = q_i / (q_i + (2χ_i / (1 - χ_i))q_i) | Canceling q_i and simplifying gives the final relationship: M_i = (1 - χ_i) / (1 + χ_i). | Final Result: | By combining these results, we can express the division of surplus as a direct function of a firm's structural network position: | r_i / s_i = 2 * ( (1 - χ_i) / (1 + χ_i) ) | This equation demonstrates that a firm's ability to capture surplus is entirely determined by its product market centrality, a measure derived from the underlying topology of the product space.", "checklist": "1.

In such a model, the single friction of expenditure stickiness gives rise to two distinct, analytically separable strategic incentives for deficit spending. | 1. The Model's Foundational Environment | Political Structure: Two parties (A and B) with mutually exclusive preferences for two public goods (g_A and g_B) alternate in power. The incumbent at time t seeks to maximize a utility function that heavily weights its preferred good. | Fiscal Framework: Expenditures are financed by a fixed tax revenue (T) and the issuance of single-period debt (D). The government budget constraint is g_{A,t} + g_{B,t} = T + D_t. | The Core Friction: Expenditure Stickiness (φ): This is the central institutional constraint. It dictates that the current administration must fund at least a fraction φ ∈ of the previous administration's expenditure on each good. Formally, for an incumbent A at time t, who inherits the budget (g_{A,t-1}, g_{B,t-1}): | Constraint 1: g_{A,t} ≥ φ * g_{A,t-1} | Constraint 2: g_{B,t} ≥ φ * g_{B,t-1} | This constraint creates an explicit intertemporal link in policymaking. | 2. The Two Distinct Strategic Deficit-Driving Mechanisms | Mechanism 1: The Lock-in Effect (The \"Policy Insurance\" Motive) | Activating Condition: This motive exists whenever φ > 0. | Strategic Logic: An incumbent (say, Party A) recognizes that its current spending decisions will bind its successor's hands. By increasing its preferred spending g_{A,t} today via debt financing, it establishes a higher baseline φ * g_{A,t} that the next government will be forced to maintain. This acts as a form of \"policy insurance,\" ensuring the survival of preferred projects against political turnover. | Key Quantitative Finding (The Inverted-U Relationship): The incentive to use debt for lock-in is non-monotonic with respect to the level of stickiness φ: | Low φ: The lock-in mechanism is new and powerful. Each marginal increase in spending creates significant future policy persistence. The incentive to issue debt to exploit this powerful new tool is very strong. | High φ: The budget is already highly constrained and rigid. The marginal benefit of creating additional lock-in is minimal, while fiscal space is limited by large inherited expenditures. The incentive to add more debt for this purpose diminishes significantly. | Mechanism 2: The Dilution Effect (The \"Sequestration Gaming\" Motive) | Activating Conditions: This motive is triggered only when two conditions are met simultaneously: | The presence of a sequestration rule: an automatic, proportional budget cut if total expenditures exceed revenues. | The incumbent inherits a budget with a large share of non-preferred spending. | Strategic Logic (Step-by-Step): | The Threat: Incumbent A anticipates that due to the large inherited spending on g_B, a budget sequester is inevitable. All projects will be cut by a percentage k. | The Calculation: The incumbent realizes that the final amount of its preserved project spending is g'{A,t} = (1-k) * g{A,t}. | The Strategic Action: The incumbent uses debt to unilaterally and massively inflate its own spending, g_{A,t}. This \"dilution\" intentionally inflates the total budget denominator. | The Payoff: While this increases the deficit, the incumbent's share of the budget (g_{A,t} / (g_{A,t} + g_{B,t})) becomes overwhelmingly large. As a result, the final absolute amount of its preferred spending that survives the cut is higher than it would have been without this maneuver. It sacrifices fiscal health to shield its pet projects. | 3. Policy Implications and An Institutional Remedy | The analysis can isolate these distinct effects. When φ>0 but there is no sequestration, only the Lock-in Effect is active. When sequestration is also present, both effects are active, with the Dilution Effect creating a much more severe and explosive deficit bias. | An institutional reform, such as mandatory bipartisan negotiation, can be modeled to address these issues. This reform is highly effective because it directly neutralizes the Dilution Effect. The dilution strategy relies on the incumbent's ability to unilaterally inflate its budget share. Under mandatory negotiation, the opposition party would recognize this self-serving maneuver and veto it, removing the strategic incentive at its root and forcing a compromise that restores fiscal discipline.", "checklist": "1.

Conceptual Foundation and Motivation for a New Model | Classical discrete choice models, such as the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model derived from Luce's choice axiom, are foundational but suffer from the property of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). IIA implies that the ratio of probabilities of choosing two alternatives is independent of any other alternatives in the choice set. This leads to the \"red bus, blue bus\" paradox: if a consumer is indifferent between a car and a blue bus (50/50 choice), introducing a nearly identical red bus should intuitively take market share almost exclusively from the blue bus. However, the MNL model predicts the car would retain a 33.3% market share, and each bus would get 33.3%, which is unrealistic. Furthermore, these models predict that a superior product's market share will diminish to zero as an infinite number of inferior products are introduced. | To address these shortcomings, we design the Weighted Linear (WL) model of discrete choice, which is both tractable and more empirically realistic. It characterizes choice probability by two parameters for each alternative x: its intrinsic utility u(x) and its \"salience\" m(x), which captures prominence or accessibility in a consumer's mind. | 2. The Weighted Linear (WL) Model Formulation | The probability of choosing an alternative x from a choice set S is given by: | p(x|S) = m(x)/m(S) + m(x) * [u(x) - ū_m(S)] | Where: | u(x): A scalar representing the intrinsic utility of alternative x. | m(x): A positive scalar representing the salience of x. Higher m(x) means the alternative is more prominent. | m(S) = Σ_{y∈S} m(y): The total salience of all alternatives in the set. | ū_m(S) = (Σ_{y∈S} u(y)m(y)) / m(S): The salience-weighted average utility in the set S. | This structure elegantly combines two mechanisms: a base probability proportional to salience (a Luce-like term), and a comparative probability transfer reflecting the difference between an item's utility and the weighted-average utility of its competitors, amplified by the item's own salience. | 3. Microfoundation from Costly Attention | The WL model can be derived as the solution to a problem where a representative agent chooses probabilities p(x|S) to maximize expected utility, penalized by the cognitive cost of paying attention. The cost is assumed to be quadratic in probability and inversely related to salience. | Objective Function: max_{p(·|S)} [ Σ_{x∈S} u(x)p(x|S) - Σ_{x∈S} (1 / (2m(x))) * p(x|S)² ] subject to the constraint Σ_{x∈S} p(x|S) = 1. | The Lagrangian is L = Σ u(x)p(x) - Σ (p(x)² / (2m(x))) - λ(Σ p(x) - 1). | The first-order condition with respect to p(x) is: ∂L/∂p(x) = u(x) - p(x)/m(x) - λ = 0. This gives p(x|S) = m(x)[u(x) - λ(S)]. | Summing over all x in S: Σ p(x|S) = 1 = Σ m(x)[u(x) - λ(S)] = Σ m(x)u(x) - λ(S)Σ m(x). | This can be solved for the Lagrange multiplier λ(S): λ(S) = ū_m(S) - 1/m(S). | Substituting λ(S) back into the expression for p(x|S) yields the WL model formula: | p(x|S) = m(x)[u(x) - (ū_m(S) - 1/m(S))] = m(x)/m(S) + m(x)[u(x) - ū_m(S)]. | 4. Resolution of Paradoxes and Model Properties | Overcoming IIA: The cross-price elasticity (change in p(x) due to change in u(y)) is ∂p(x|S)/∂u(y) = -m(x)m(y)/m(S). This depends on the specific properties (m) of alternatives x and y, thus violating IIA. In the \"red bus, blue bus\" example, the two buses would have similar, high salience, leading to stronger substitution between them than with the less similar car. | Market Share Persistence: Consider a superior product x and a set T_n of n replicas of an inferior product y (with u(x) > u(y)). As n → ∞, the total salience m(S U T_n) also approaches infinity, causing the base probability term to go to zero. However, the weighted average utility ū_m(S U T_n) converges to u(y). Therefore, the limiting market share is: | lim_{n→∞} p(x|S U T_n) = m(x)[u(x) - u(y)] > 0. | The superior product retains a positive market share, determined by its salience and its utility advantage over the sea of inferior competitors. | 5. Application to Oligopolistic Competition | Consider a market with n firms in a symmetric setting where firms have the same exogenous quality ũ, marginal cost k, and advertising cost function C(m_i) = gm_i².

The Law of Motion for the Value of Money | To analyze out-of-steady-state dynamics (speculative hyperinflation), we consider a path where y_t evolves over time, so ẏ_t ≠ 0. Since y_t = V_1,t - V_0,t, we have ẏ_t = d(V_1,t)/dt - d(V_0,t)/dt. | Subtracting (1b) from (1a): | ρ(V_1,t - V_0,t) = ασ(1-M)[u(y_t) - y_t] - ασM[y_t] + (d(V_1,t)/dt - d(V_0,t)/dt) | ρy_t = ασ(1-M)u(y_t) - ασ(1-M)y_t - ασMy_t + ẏ_t | Let θ = ασ(1 – M) be the velocity of money. Rearranging gives the fundamental law of motion, an autonomous Bernoulli ordinary differential equation (ODE): | ẏ_t = (ρ + θ)y_t - θu(y_t) (2) | A speculative hyperinflation is an equilibrium path that is a solution to this ODE, starting from y_0 > 0 and converging to y=0. | 3. Derivation of the Finite Time of Death (T) | The time T it takes for money to become valueless can be found by solving this ODE. Separating variables gives: | dt = dy / [(ρ + θ)y - θu(y)] | To find the total time T for the value of money to fall from an initial state y_0 (at t=0) to zero (at t=T), we integrate both sides: | ∫(from 0 to T) dt = ∫(from y_0 to 0) dy / [(ρ + θ)y - θu(y)] | T = - ∫(from 0 to y_0) dy / [(ρ + θ)y - θu(y)] | Since the denominator is negative for small y, the expression for T is positive: | T = ∫(from 0 to y_0) dy / [θu(y) - (ρ + θ)y] (3) | 4. The Necessary and Sufficient Condition for a Finite T | The time T is finite if and only if the integral in equation (3) converges. The convergence of this improper integral depends on the behavior of the integrand 1 / [θu(y) - (ρ + θ)y] as y → 0+. | As y → 0+, the term (ρ + θ)y becomes negligible compared to θu(y). Thus, the convergence of the integral is determined by the convergence of: | ∫(from 0 to y_0) dy / [θu(y)] | This integral converges if and only if u(y) grows \"faster\" than y near the origin. More formally, T is finite if and only if ∫(from 0 to ε) [1/u(y)] dy is finite for some ε > 0. | This is the necessary and sufficient condition. A necessary (but not sufficient) part of this condition is that u'(0) = +∞. If u'(0) were finite, u(y) would behave like y * u'(0) near the origin, and ∫ 1/y dy diverges, making T infinite. | 5. Example: CRRA Preferences | Let's assume a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function: u(y) = y^(1-η) / (1-η) for 0 < η < 1. Here, u'(y) = y^(-η), so u'(0) = +∞. | Checking the integrability condition: | ∫ 1/u(y) dy = ∫ (1-η)/y^(1-η) dy = (1-η) ∫ y^(η-1) dy = (1-η) * [y^η / η]. | Evaluating this from 0 to ε gives (1-η)ε^η / η, which is finite. Therefore, the condition is met, and T must be finite. | We can solve for T explicitly. The ODE becomes ẏ_t = (ρ + θ)y_t - (θ/(1-η))y_t^(1-η). This is a Bernoulli equation. Let x_t = y_t^η. Then ẋ_t = ηy_t^(η-1)ẏ_t. Substituting gives a linear ODE for x_t: | ẋ_t = η(ρ + θ)x_t - ηθ/(1-η) | Solving this linear ODE for a path from x_0 to 0 and transforming back to y_t yields the closed-form solution for the time of death: | T = [1 / (η(ρ+θ))] * ln[1 - ((ρ+θ)(1-η)/θ) * y_0^η]^(-1) | This expression is finite for any y_0 within the basin of attraction of the non-monetary equilibrium.", "checklist": "1.

However, this query explores a more radical possibility: a complete collapse in money's value in finite time, even with a constant money supply. This can occur in a speculative equilibrium, where the expectation of a future collapse becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. To model this, one must move beyond representative-agent models and use a search-theoretic framework (like the Shi-Trejos-Wright model).

This intractability arises from the complex, two-dimensional nature of the agent's potential deviations (simultaneously misrepresenting their type and choosing a non-prescribed action). | Please propose a simplified, step-by-step \"decoupling\" procedure to identify a candidate for the optimal contract. Crucially, you must also identify and thoroughly explain the key condition that guarantees this candidate solution is, in fact, globally optimal for the full, unrestricted problem.", "golden_truth": "1. The Core Problem: Double Deviation and Intractability | In a canonical principal-agent model, a principal (e.g., a company) wants to design a contract for a risk-averse agent (e.g., a manager). The agent's utility is given by u(w) - c(a, θ), where w is the wage, u(w) is a concave utility function over wage, a is a productive but costly effort, and θ is the agent's ability or type. A higher θ signifies a more able agent, meaning their cost of effort c(a, θ) is lower (i.e., c_θ < 0 and c_aθ < 0). | The problem's intractability arises from two simultaneous information asymmetries: | Adverse Selection: The agent's type θ is their private information. | Moral Hazard: The agent's effort a is hidden from the principal. | This combination allows the agent to perform a \"double deviation\": they can first misreport their type (e.g., a high-ability agent θ_H pretends to be a low-ability agent θ_L) and then, facing the contract intended for the reported type, choose an effort level different from the one recommended. This creates a two-dimensional continuum of incentive constraints, making direct optimization of the contract menu a virtually impossible task. | 2. The \"Decoupling\" Procedure: A Four-Step Solution | The \"decoupling\" method masterfully transforms this intractable problem into a sequence of manageable steps, culminating in a simple verification condition. | Step (i): Derive the Moral Hazard Cost Function C(a, u₀, θ) | First, we isolate the moral hazard friction. For any given agent type θ, desired effort level a, and target utility level u₀ for the agent, we solve for the principal's minimum cost of implementation. This is the classic moral hazard cost-minimization problem (P_MH): | C(a, u₀, θ) = min_{w(x)} ∫ w(x) f(x|a) dx | Subject to: | Participation Constraint: ∫ u(w(x)) f(x|a) dx - c(a, θ) ≥ u₀ | Incentive Constraint (First-Order Approach): ∫ u(w(x)) f_a(x|a) dx - c_a(a, θ) = 0 | The solution to this problem is the famed Holmström-Mirrlees contract, where the agent's payment w(x) is structured to align incentives optimally. Its form is characterized by the first-order conditions of the Lagrangian, which imply 1/u'(w(x)) = λ + μ * [f_a(x|a)/f(x|a)], where λ and μ are the Lagrange multipliers on the participation and incentive constraints, respectively. This step abstracts away the complex contract form w(x) into a single, well-behaved cost function C(a, u₀, θ). | Step (ii): Solve the Relaxed Screening Problem (P_D) | With the cost function in hand, we now address the adverse selection friction in a simplified \"decoupled problem\". The principal chooses an effort schedule a(θ) and a utility (surplus) schedule S(θ) to maximize profits, subject only to local truth-telling constraints: | max_{a(θ), S(θ)} ∫ [B(a(θ)) - C(a(θ), S(θ), θ)] h(θ) dθ | Subject to: | Local Incentive Compatibility: S'(θ) = -c_θ(a(θ), θ) | Participation: S(θ) must satisfy the agent's outside option. | The key constraint S'(θ) = -c_θ(a(θ), θ) is a direct result of the envelope theorem. It precisely defines the \"information rent\" that must be paid to a higher-type agent to induce them to reveal their type truthfully. It states that the rate of increase of an agent's utility with their type is equal to their informational advantage (the reduction in cost, -c_θ > 0). This is a standard optimal control problem that can be solved for the candidate schedules a*(θ) and S*(θ). | Step (iii): Reconstruct the Full Contract Menu | This step is straightforward. For each type θ, we take the optimal a*(θ) and S*(θ) found in Step (ii) and plug them back into the problem from Step (i). This gives us the specific Holmström-Mirrlees wage contract w*(x, θ) that implements the desired outcome for that type. | Step (iv): Verification | The solution from the first three steps is only a candidate, as it was derived by ignoring global deviations. The final, critical step is to verify if this candidate solution is truly optimal. This leads to the central condition of the theory. | 3. The Key to Verification: The Increasing Marginal Cost (IMC) Condition | The entire procedure's validity hinges on whether the candidate solution a*(θ) satisfies the Increasing Marginal Cost (IMC) Condition. | Definition: The action schedule a(θ) satisfies IMC if the agent's marginal cost of effort, c_a, evaluated along this schedule, is strictly increasing in their type θ. | Mathematical Formulation: | d/dθ [c_a(a(θ), θ)] > 0 | Expanding via the chain rule gives the precise inequality: | c_aa(a(θ), θ) * a'(θ) + c_aθ(a(θ), θ) > 0 | Where: | c_aa > 0 is the convexity of the effort cost. | a'(θ) is the slope of the recommended effort schedule. | c_aθ < 0 represents the fact that higher-ability types have a lower marginal cost of effort (the standard single-crossing property). | The Main Sufficiency Theorem: If the first-order approach is valid, and the candidate solution a*(θ) from the decoupled problem satisfies the IMC condition, then the contract menu w*(x, θ) is the global optimum for the full, intractable problem. | 4. The Deep Intuition of IMC: How It Thwarts Double Deviations | The IMC condition is not just a mathematical curiosity; it has a profound economic intuition. It is precisely the property needed to ensure that no agent type has an incentive to perform a double deviation. | Let's trace the logic of a potential deviation: | The Temptation: Consider a high-ability agent, θ_H. They look at the menu of contracts and are tempted by the one offered to a low-ability agent, θ_L. Why? To motivate the less capable θ_L, her contract w(x, θ_L) must be \"high-powered\"—that is, very sensitive to performance to provide strong incentives. This high-powered scheme is attractive to θ_H. | The Double Deviation in Action: If θ_H mimics θ_L, they will not simply accept the recommended effort a(θ_L). Facing the high-powered incentives of w(x, θ_L) but possessing a low marginal cost of effort, θ_H will find it optimal to re-optimize and choose a higher effort level â > a(θ_L). This is the double deviation: lie about type, then deviate on action. | How IMC Defeats the Deviation: This is where the IMC condition works its magic. For the inequality c_aa * a' + c_aθ > 0 to hold, given that c_aθ is negative, the term c_aa * a' must be sufficiently large and positive. This means the recommended effort schedule a(θ) must be steeply increasing (a'(θ) is large). | This steepness ensures that the marginal cost of effort for the agent as perceived by the principal (c_a(a(θ), θ)) rises with ability. When the high-ability agent θ_H considers mimicking θ_L, they see a contract that induces a much lower effort level a(θ_L). While the contract is high-powered, the prescribed task is \"too easy.\" Any attempt to exploit this by increasing effort (â > a(θ_L)) is ultimately suboptimal. The IMC condition guarantees that the overall utility from any such deviation strategy is less than the utility from being truthful and accepting the contract w(x, θ_H) with its corresponding effort a(θ_H). | In essence, IMC ensures that the contracts are structured such that it is prohibitively \"costly\" in terms of effort misalignment for a high-type agent to take advantage of a contract designed for a low-type agent. It makes the entire menu incentive-compatible on a global scale, validating the decoupling approach.", "checklist": "1.

If a permutation contains either pattern, the sorting process inevitably outputs elements in the wrong order. Conversely, if a permutation avoids both, all steps of the PSB algorithm are valid, and the permutation is successfully sorted.

Enumeration via Motzkin Paths and Fibonacci Numbers | Sortable permutations can be encoded as ternary words built from the PSB operations (PUSH = 0, BYPASS = 1, POP+PUSH = 2). These words must begin with 0, end with 0 or 2, and avoid the factor 12. This encoding establishes a bijection with a restricted class of Motzkin paths: paths start with an up-step, end with a down-step, avoid adjacent horizontal–down or down–horizontal pairs, and enforce immediate return to the axis after each down-step.

The MET asserts that under ergodic driving, the algebra decomposes as | \\mathcal{M}d = \\mathcal{M}\\infty^\\Phi \\oplus \\mathcal{M}\\infty^{\\Phi,\\perp}, | with \\dim \\mathcal{M}\\infty^\\Phi constant almost surely, enforced by ergodicity. On the complementary space, iterates contract exponentially: for a \\in \\mathcal{M}\\infty^{\\Phi,\\perp}, | \\|\\Phi^{(n)}\\omega(a)\\|{HS} \\leq C e^{n\\kappa}\\|a\\|{HS}, \\quad \\kappa < 0. | Moreover, the restriction of \\Phi_\\omega to \\mathcal{M}_\\infty^\\Phi defines isometric isomorphisms between successive domains, ensuring stability of the asymptotic algebra. This structural decomposition parallels Oseledets’ theorem in classical ergodic theory. | | 2. Entanglement breaking under disorder | A channel is entanglement breaking (EB) if its image lies in an abelian \\text{C}^*-subalgebra. For random bcp maps, asymptotic EB is equivalent to the asymptotic multiplicative domain \\mathcal{M}\\infty^\\Phi being abelian. This can be expressed via Hilbert–Schmidt convergence: | \\lim{n \\to \\infty} d_{HS}(\\Phi^{(n)}\\omega, \\mathcal{E}) = 0, \\quad \\text{a.s.}, | where \\mathcal{E} is the EB set. Importantly, if the driving dynamics include occasionally PPT maps (completely positive under partial transpose), then ergodicity forces \\mathcal{M}\\infty^\\Phi to be abelian almost surely. Thus, randomness ensures that even partial presence of PPT maps drives the system towards entanglement breaking. This result provides explicit conditions and links algebraic structure to physical EB behavior, while ergodic averages yield quantitative timescales for the onset of entanglement loss. | | 3. Extension of Kuperberg’s theorem to random i.i.d. setting | In the i.i.d. random case, the asymptotic multiplicative domain is non-random almost surely, collapsing to a fixed \\text{C}^*-subalgebra \\mathcal{A}. This algebra can be characterized spectrally: elements v \\in \\mathcal{A} evolve as eigenvectors, | \\Phi^{(n)}_\\omega(v) = \\lambda^n v, \\quad |\\lambda|=1. | Thus, the asymptotic structure is determined by a deterministic algebra carrying phase rotations. This generalizes Kuperberg’s theorem on deterministic bcp maps to the random setting, showing that ergodic randomness preserves structural regularity in the limit. The extension provides necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence of random compositions, and gives an explicit description of their limiting algebraic behavior, clarifying how random fluctuations average out in the long run. | | 4. Finite-time entanglement breaking and probabilistic bounds | Beyond asymptotics, finite-time analysis investigates explicit stopping times when a random composition becomes EB. Define the eventual EB time | \\iota(\\omega) = \\inf\\{n : \\Phi^{(n)}_\\omega \\in \\mathcal{E}\\}. | Ergodicity imposes a 0–1 law: with probability one, EB either eventually occurs or never occurs. For primitive maps (those driving all states to full rank), eventual EB coincides with asymptotic EB, and exponential convergence bounds ensure rapid approach to the maximally mixed channel. Probabilistic estimates quantify the likelihood that EB occurs by time n, yielding explicit upper and lower bounds. This links finite-time breaking to asymptotic EB and provides concrete timescales for entanglement decay in random environments. | |", "checklist": "1.

Formulation of Bounds | | Let (R,\\mathfrak m) be a Cohen–Macaulay local ring of prime characteristic p>0. Denote: | • d = \\dim(R) (Krull dimension), | • v = \\text{emb.dim}(R) (embedding dimension, the minimal number of generators of \\mathfrak m), | • s = \\text{type}(R) = \\dim_k \\operatorname{Ext}^d_R(k,R) (the Cohen–Macaulay type), | • \\operatorname{Fte}(R) = Frobenius test exponent for parameter ideals, | • and set Q = p^{\\operatorname{Fte}(R)}. | | The goal is to provide explicit upper bounds for the Hilbert–Samuel multiplicity e(R) in terms of these invariants. The multiplicity e(R) can be interpreted as the leading coefficient of the Hilbert–Samuel polynomial of \\mathfrak m, and serves as a key measure of the singularity of R. | | Earlier results: | • Huneke–Watanabe (2015) established sharp bounds for Gorenstein F-pure/F-rational rings, expressed solely in terms of d and v. | • Katzman–Zhang (2019) generalized using the Hartshorne–Speiser–Lyubeznik number (HSL), obtaining a weaker bound: | e(R) \\le Q^{\\,v-d}\\binom{v}{d}. | | Our target is to sharpen these bounds in the general Cohen–Macaulay setting by incorporating the type s and proving exact formulas for odd and even dimensions. | | 2. Main Theorem with Complete Proof | | 2.1 Statement | | Theorem (Main Bound). | Let (R,\\mathfrak m) be a Cohen–Macaulay local ring of prime characteristic p, with invariants d,v,s as above, and set Q = p^{\\operatorname{Fte}(R)}. Then: | • If d = 2r+1 (odd dimension): | e(R) \\le (s+1)\\,Q^{\\,v-d}\\binom{v-r-1}{r}. | • If d = 2r (even dimension): | e(R) \\le \\frac{s+1}{2}\\, Q^{\\,v-d}\\Big(\\binom{v-r}{r}+\\binom{v-r-1}{r-1}\\Big). | | These bounds extend Huneke–Watanabe’s results for the Gorenstein case (s=1) ￼. | | 2.2 Proof Outline and Key Steps | | We give the proof for the odd-dimensional case d=2r+1, which is the central argument. The even-dimensional case follows with minor modifications in the choice of parameters. | | Step 1. Minimal reductions and Frobenius scaling | | Choose a minimal reduction of \\mathfrak m, denoted \\mathfrak q=(x_1,\\dots,x_d). Since the residue field is infinite, such a minimal reduction exists. The Hilbert–Samuel multiplicity is stable under minimal reductions, i.e. | e(R) = e(\\mathfrak m) = e(\\mathfrak q). | | Now, scaling under Frobenius gives: | e(\\mathfrak q) = \\frac{1}{Q^d}\\, e(\\mathfrak q^{[Q]}). | | Thus, bounding e(R) reduces to bounding the length of R/\\mathfrak q^{[Q]}. | | | Step 2. Frobenius closure and Briançon–Skoda | | The Briançon–Skoda theorem states: if I is generated by n elements, then | I^{n+w} \\subseteq (I^{w+1})^. | For parameter ideals \\mathfrak q, this implies: | \\mathfrak q^d \\subseteq \\mathfrak q^. | | In Cohen–Macaulay rings with finite \\operatorname{Fte}(R), we have equality \\mathfrak q^* = \\mathfrak q^F (tight closure equals Frobenius closure). Thus: | \\mathfrak m^d \\subseteq \\mathfrak q^F. | | Applying Frobenius with exponent Q, we deduce: | \\mathfrak m^{dQ} \\subseteq \\mathfrak q^{[Q]}. | Step 3. Passage to quotient | | Define | A = R/\\mathfrak q^{[Q]},\\quad \\mathfrak n = \\mathfrak m/\\mathfrak q^{[Q]}. | | Then: | e(R) = \\frac{1}{Q^d} e(\\mathfrak q^{[Q]}) \\le \\frac{1}{Q^d} \\ell_R(A), | since the multiplicity of an ideal is bounded above by the length of its quotient. | | Step 4. Artinian decomposition and socle argument | | For any integer l with 1 \\le l \\le d-1, we have a short exact sequence: | 0 \\to \\mathfrak n^l \\to A \\to A/\\mathfrak n^l \\to 0, | hence | \\ell(A) = \\ell(A/\\mathfrak n^l) + \\ell(\\mathfrak n^l). | | Now apply the Artinian length lemma: | For an Artinian local ring B and finitely generated module M with socle dimension \\dim_k \\operatorname{Soc}(M)=s, we have | \\ell_B(M) \\le s \\cdot \\ell_B(B). | | In our setting, \\dim_k \\operatorname{Soc}(A) = s (by definition of type). Hence | \\ell(\\mathfrak n^l) \\le s \\cdot \\ell(A/\\mathfrak n^l). | | Thus, | \\ell(A) \\le (s+1)\\cdot \\ell(A/\\mathfrak n^l). | | Step 5. Monomial counting | | The quotient A/\\mathfrak n^l can be described via monomials in the generators of \\mathfrak m, modulo the Frobenius powers of \\mathfrak q. Careful counting of admissible monomials gives: | \\ell(A/\\mathfrak n^l) \\le Q^v \\binom{v-d+l-1}{l-1}. | | Step 6. Choice of l | | For odd dimension d=2r+1, set l=r+1. Substituting yields: | e(R) \\le (s+1)Q^{\\,v-d}\\binom{v-r-1}{r}. | | This completes the proof for the odd-dimensional case. The even-dimensional case is analogous, with l=r, and yields the stated formula with an extra factor of 1/2. | | 3. Special Cases and Sharpness | | 3.1 F-pure rings | | If R is F-pure, then every ideal is Frobenius closed, so \\operatorname{Fte}(R)=0, hence Q=1. The general bound specializes to: | • d=2r+1: | e(R) \\le (s+1)\\binom{v-r-1}{r}. | • d=2r: | e(R) \\le \\frac{s+1}{2}\\Big(\\binom{v-r}{r}+\\binom{v-r-1}{r-1}\\Big). | | For the Gorenstein case (s=1), these coincide with Huneke–Watanabe’s original bounds ￼. | | | | 3.2 F-rational rings | | An F-rational ring is Cohen–Macaulay with tightly closed parameter ideals. In this setting, again \\operatorname{Fte}(R)=0 and Q=1. | • If additionally Gorenstein (s=1), we recover the sharp Huneke–Watanabe inequalities for F-rational rings. | | | 3.3 F-nilpotent rings | | If R is F-nilpotent, the containments become stronger, yielding an improved constant factor. | • For odd d=2r+1: | e(R) \\le \\frac{s+1}{2}\\,Q^{\\,v-d}\\binom{v-r-1}{r}. | • For even d=2r: | e(R) \\le (s+1)Q^{\\,v-d}\\binom{v-r-1}{r-1}. | | The proof uses symmetry in the Artinian length decomposition: | \\ell(A) = \\ell(A/\\mathfrak n^l) + \\ell(\\mathfrak n^l), | and F-nilpotency forces these two terms to have comparable length, effectively halving the constant from (s+1) to (s+1)/2. | | 3.4 Explicit Examples | • Example 1 (1-dimensional Gorenstein): | R = \\mathbb F_p[X,Y]/(X^aY^a). | Computations show that \\operatorname{Fte}(R)=\\lceil \\log_p(a)\\rceil, and the multiplicity exactly equals the bound. | • Example 2 (2-dimensional F-nilpotent CM ring): | R = \\mathbb F_p[[x,y,z]]/(x^p,y^p,z^p). | Here \\mathfrak m^p=0, so F-nilpotency holds. Direct calculation shows e(R) matches the refined bound. | | These demonstrate sharpness of the inequalities ￼. | | | | 3.5 Asymptotics | | For fixed d and growing embedding dimension v: | e(R) = O\\!\\big(Q^{\\,v-d}\\, v^r\\big). | Thus the multiplicity grows polynomially in v (of degree r=\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor), with exponential scaling in Q. | | | | 4. Technical Tools and Containments | | 4.1 Briançon–Skoda theorem | | Theorem. Let I\\subseteq R be generated by n elements. Then for all w\\ge0: | I^{n+w}\\subseteq (I^{w+1})^*. | | Corollary. If I is a parameter ideal of dimension d, then | I^d \\subseteq I^*. | | 4.2 Frobenius and tight closure | | For F-nilpotent rings, it is known that tight closure coincides with Frobenius closure on parameter ideals: | I^* = I^F. | This equality is essential in showing \\mathfrak m^d \\subseteq \\mathfrak q^F. | | 4.3 Artinian length lemma | | Lemma. If (A,\\mathfrak n) is Artinian local and \\dim_k\\operatorname{Soc}(M)=s, then | \\ell_A(M) \\le s \\cdot \\ell_A(A). | Proof sketch: The socle is essential in M, so M\\subseteq E^s, where E is the injective hull of the residue field. By Matlis duality, \\ell(E)=\\ell(A). Hence the inequality. | | | | 4.4 Monomial counting | | Given A=R/\\mathfrak q^{[Q]} and generators x_1,\\dots,x_d,y_1,\\dots,y_{v-d}, the quotient A/\\mathfrak n^l has a k-basis consisting of monomials with exponent constraints. Counting shows: | \\ell(A/\\mathfrak n^l) \\le Q^v \\binom{v-d+l-1}{l-1}. | | | | 5. Local Cohomology Mechanism | | 5.1 Frobenius actions | | The Frobenius endomorphism induces actions on local cohomology modules H^i_{\\mathfrak m}(R). | | Define the Hartshorne–Speiser–Lyubeznik number: | \\operatorname{HSL}(H^i_{\\mathfrak m}(R)) = \\min\\{e \\mid F^e(0^F_{H^i_{\\mathfrak m}(R)})=0\\}. | | Then set | \\operatorname{HSL}(R) = \\max_i \\operatorname{HSL}(H^i_{\\mathfrak m}(R)). | | | | 5.2 Equivalence with Frobenius test exponent | | It is a result of Katzman–Sharp (and subsequent refinements) that in Cohen–Macaulay rings: | \\operatorname{Fte}(R) = \\operatorname{HSL}(R). | | Thus the exponent Q governing the multiplicity bound is precisely the nilpotency index of Frobenius acting on top local cohomology. | | | | 5.3 Mechanism of control | | The identity | (\\mathfrak q^F)^{[Q]} = \\mathfrak q^{[Q]} | follows directly from the definition of \\operatorname{Fte}(R). This ensures that all extra elements entering via Frobenius closure vanish after Q-th Frobenius power. | | This stabilization is what allows us to relate Frobenius closure containments with length bounds of Artinian quotients, thereby controlling multiplicity. | | | | Conclusion | • The sharp multiplicity bounds are established in terms of d,v,s,Q. | • Full proofs rely on: Briançon–Skoda containment, Frobenius closure properties, Artinian length arguments, and monomial counting. | • Special cases (F-pure, F-rational, F-nilpotent) yield simplified or refined constants. | • Explicit examples confirm sharpness. | • The mechanism hinges on the identification \\operatorname{Fte}(R)=\\operatorname{HSL}(R), tying Frobenius actions on local cohomology to multiplicity theory. | |", "checklist": "1.

Basic evidence and unconditional cases | | ### 4.1 Non-constant polynomials never stay prime | | Let $f\\in\\mathbb Z[n]$ be non-constant and map $\\mathbb I\\to\\mathbb I$. Pick $n_0$ with $f(n_0)>1$ and a prime $p\\mid f(n_0)$. Then $f(n_0+p)\\equiv f(n_0)\\equiv 0\\pmod p$ but $f(n_0+p)>f(n_0)>1$, hence $f(n_0+p)$ is composite. Thus $f(\\mathbb I)\\nsubseteq\\mathbb P$. | | ### 4.2 Exponential shifts $a^n+b$ | | Let $a>1,\\ b\\in\\mathbb N$, $f(n)=a^n+b$. If $p\\mid f(n_0)$ and $p\\nmid a$, then by Fermat’s little theorem, | $a^{n_0+(p-1)}\\equiv a^{n_0}\\pmod p$, so $f(n_0+p-1)\\equiv f(n_0)\\equiv 0\\pmod p$ and $f(n_0+p-1)>f(n_0)>1$, hence composite. If $p\\mid a$ then $p<f(n_0)$ and $f(n_0)$ is already composite. So $f(\\mathbb I)\\nsubseteq\\mathbb P$. | | ### 4.3 Fermat numbers | | For $F(n)=2^{2^n}+1$, one has $F(5)=4294967297=641\\cdot 6700417$ (Euler), so $F(\\mathbb I)\\nsubseteq\\mathbb P$. | | These three families are **natural functions**, so they match the conjecture’s prediction already in unconditional form. | | --- | | ## 5. Consequences conditional on the conjecture | | ### 5.1 Infinitely many composite values in each natural sequence | | For any non-constant $f\\in F_{\\text{Nat}}$, the set $\\{x\\in f(\\mathbb I): x\\ \\text{composite}\\}$ is infinite. | *Reason.* Since $f$ is strictly increasing, for each $k$ the shifted map $g(n)=f(n+k)$ is natural; by the conjecture $g$ attains a composite value at some $n=d$. Then $q=d+k>k$ and $f(q)$ is composite. As $k$ is arbitrary, we obtain infinitely many distinct composite values. | | ### 5.2 Infinitely many composite Fermat numbers | | Applying 5.1 to $F(n)=2^{2^n}+1$ shows there would be infinitely many composite Fermat numbers—precisely the long-standing open phenomenon this conjecture would settle. | | ### 5.3 If the conjecture were false | | A counterexample would be a **non-constant** $f\\in F_{\\text{Nat}}$ whose image consists **only** of primes. This would be an “arithmetical” closed-form prime generator using only $\\{+,\\,\\times,\\,\\wedge\\}$, producing arbitrarily large primes in order (since $f$ must be strictly increasing). Such a formula would be an extraordinary breakthrough and is widely considered implausible. | | --- | | ## 6. Supporting computational evidence (indicative) | | Systematic experiments on non-polynomial natural functions show that even when the first few values happen to be prime, a composite appears quickly. For example, besides the Fermat map, functions of the form $n\\mapsto 2^{2^n}+2k+1$ were examined; several choices give primes for $n=1,\\dots,4$, and one variant $2^{2^n}+93$ yields primes for $1\\le n<7$, yet each sequence soon hits a composite value (see the tables and factorizations on pp. 5–6).

The vertices of the Voronoi diagram are linked to the combinatorics of point sets, where the coefficients of this polynomial provide insights into the geometric arrangement of the points in $S$. | | 2. **Circle Polynomial** | The circle polynomial $p_C(z)$ is defined as: | | $$ | p_C(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-3} c_k z^k, | $$ | | where $c_k$ counts the number of circles passing through three points of $S$ and enclosing exactly $k$ other points of $S$. The relationship between the circle polynomial and the Voronoi diagram is critical in understanding the spatial structure of the points and their influence on the rectilinear crossing number. | | 3. **$(\\leq k)$-Edge Polynomial** | The $(\\leq k)$-edge polynomial $p_E(z)$ is defined as: | | $$ | p_E(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-3} E_{\\leq k} z^k, | $$ | | where $E_{\\leq k}$ counts the number of edges in the set $S$ that have at most $k$ points on one side. This polynomial encodes higher-order geometric properties of the set, linking the arrangement of edges to the combinatorial structure of the Voronoi diagram. | | ### **Mathematical Insights and Contributions**: | | * **Crossing Number Expression**: The rectilinear crossing number $cr(S)$ can be derived from the derivatives of the polynomials $p_V(z)$, $p_C(z)$, and $p_E(z)$ evaluated at $z = 1$: | | * For $p_C(z)$: | | $$ | p'_C(1) = \\binom{n}{4} + cr(S) | $$ | * For $p_V(z)$: | | $$ | p'_V(1) = \\binom{n}{3} + 2 \\binom{n}{4} + 2cr(S) | $$ | * For $p_E(z)$: | | $$ | p'_E(1) = 9 \\binom{n}{4} - cr(S) | $$ | | These relationships establish a direct connection between the coefficients of the polynomials and the crossing number, allowing for its computation in terms of algebraic quantities. | | * **Roots of the Polynomials**: The roots of the **circle polynomial** $p_C(z)$ and **Voronoi polynomial** $p_V(z)$ are critical in determining the geometric arrangement of the points. In particular, the roots of the Voronoi polynomial lie on the **unit circle** if and only if the set $S$ is in **convex position**. This result is significant because it provides a geometric characterization of the point set's configuration, linking the crossing number to the distribution of roots. | | * **Lower Bound on Root Modulus**: For sets of points in general position, bounds on the modulus of the largest root of the **circle polynomial** $p_C(z)$ and **Voronoi polynomial** $p_V(z)$ are derived. Specifically, for point sets that minimize the rectilinear crossing number $cr(S) = \\alpha \\cdot \\binom{n}{4}$, the largest root of $p_V(z)$ is bounded below by: | | $$ | |z_{\\text{max}}| \\geq 1 + \\frac{(1-\\alpha) \\pi}{16(n-3)^2} + O\\left(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\right) | $$ | | This provides a lower bound on the root locations, which is essential for understanding the behavior of the crossing number with respect to point set configurations. | | * **Generalization to $(\\leq k)$-Edge Polynomial**: A similar approach is applied to the **$(\\leq k)$-edge polynomial**, yielding bounds on the largest modulus of its roots.

Specifically, how are quotient rings of Ore polynomials defined, how does the sum-rank metric code structure work with evaluation maps, and what are the bounds on the dimension and minimum distance of these codes compared to classical bounds like Goppa’s and Gilbert–Varshamov?", "golden_truth": "The theory of **linearized Algebraic Geometry (AG) codes in the sum-rank metric** introduces a new class of codes that extend the rich interplay between algebraic geometry and coding theory into a noncommutative framework. These codes arise from combining **Ore polynomial rings** with the function fields of algebraic curves, thereby generalizing both classical AG codes (in the Hamming metric) and linearized Reed–Solomon or Gabidulin codes (in rank and sum-rank metrics). Their construction not only provides explicit new families of codes but also yields parameter bounds that surpass existing performance thresholds, including asymptotic improvements over the Gilbert–Varshamov (GV) bound. | | --- | | ## 1. Ore Polynomial Rings and Noncommutative Riemann–Roch Theory | | The foundation of this construction lies in **Ore polynomial rings**. Given a cyclic Galois extension $L/K$ of function fields of curves with automorphism $\\Phi$, one considers the Ore polynomial ring $L[T;\\Phi]$, where multiplication is twisted by the relation | | $$ | T \\cdot a = \\Phi(a) T, \\quad a \\in L. | $$ | | Taking the quotient by relations of the form $T^r - x$, with $x \\in K^\\times$, yields algebras $D_{L,x} = L[T;\\Phi]/(T^r - x)$. These are central simple algebras that behave as noncommutative analogues of function fields. | | Within this setting, one extends **divisor theory** and the **Riemann–Roch framework**. For each divisor on a covering curve $Y$ lying above a base curve $X$, one defines a Riemann–Roch space $\\Lambda_{L,x}(E)$ consisting of Ore polynomial elements subject to valuation constraints at places of $Y$. These spaces are finite-dimensional over the base field and admit explicit lower bounds on their dimensions, closely paralleling the classical Riemann–Roch theorem. Thus, the classical geometric machinery of divisors and function spaces is successfully transplanted into the noncommutative Ore polynomial environment. | | --- | | ## 2. Sum-Rank Metric and Evaluation Mechanism | | The **sum-rank metric** interpolates between Hamming and rank metrics. Given vector space tuples $W = (W_1,\\dots,W_s)$ and $V = (V_1,\\dots,V_s)$, the ambient space | | $$ | \\text{Hom}_k(W,V) = \\prod_{i=1}^s \\text{Hom}_k(W_i, V_i) | $$ | | carries the sum-rank weight, defined as the sum of the ranks of each linear map. A code in this metric is a linear subspace of this ambient space. | | The construction of linearized AG codes proceeds by defining **evaluation maps**. Fixing rational places on the base curve, one evaluates Ore polynomial functions in the Riemann–Roch space at selected points, producing tuples of linear maps in the ambient space. These evaluations, reduced modulo appropriate local parameters, yield matrices that form the codewords. This mechanism is the natural generalization of evaluating rational functions at rational points to obtain classical AG codes, but now within a noncommutative algebraic framework. | | --- | | ## 3. Explicit Construction and Hypotheses for Well-Defined Codes | | A **linearized Algebraic Geometry code** is defined as the image of the multi-evaluation map | | $$ | \\alpha : \\Lambda_{L,x}(E) \\to \\prod_{i=1}^s \\text{End}_k(V_i), | $$ | | where $E$ is a chosen divisor on the covering curve, and the $V_i$ are local quotient spaces at evaluation places. Several hypotheses guarantee that this construction is well-defined: | | * The algebra $D_{L,x}$ must contain no zero divisors, ensuring injectivity of evaluation. | * Compatibility conditions at evaluation places must hold so that Ore elements can be consistently reduced. | | Under these assumptions, the codes are rigorously defined, and their parameters can be studied with precision. | | --- | | ## 4. Parameter Bounds: Dimension and Minimum Distance | | The central result concerns **parameter bounds**. For a code $C$ constructed from divisor $E$, one obtains: | | * A **dimension bound**: | | $$ | \\dim C \\;\\geq\\; r \\cdot \\deg(E) - r \\cdot (g_Y - 1) - \\text{local correction terms}, | $$ | | where $g_Y$ is the genus of the covering curve $Y$, and the correction terms depend on ramification and local invariants. | | * A **minimum distance bound**: | | $$ | d \\;\\geq\\; sr - \\deg(E), | $$ | | where $s$ is the number of evaluation places and $r$ the extension degree. | | These bounds generalize Goppa’s bounds for classical AG codes in the Hamming metric. Importantly, the codes simultaneously exhibit large dimension and large minimum distance, a hallmark of good code families. | | --- | | ## 5. Comparison with Classical Bounds | | The parameters of linearized AG codes satisfy an analogue of the Singleton inequality in the sum-rank metric. More significantly, in appropriate field settings—such as finite fields of square cardinality—these codes yield families that **asymptotically surpass the Gilbert–Varshamov bound** in the sum-rank metric. This result mirrors the landmark Tsfasman–Vlăduţ–Zink breakthrough for AG codes in the Hamming metric, establishing that geometry-based constructions can again outperform random coding bounds in a broader metric context. | | --- | | ## 6. Relation to Reed–Solomon and Gabidulin Codes | | Linearized AG codes recover known families as special cases: | | * For the projective line as the base curve, the construction reduces to **linearized Reed–Solomon codes**, which are maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes attaining the Singleton bound. | * By varying evaluation, one recovers **Gabidulin codes**, the classical rank-metric analogue of Reed–Solomon codes. | | Compared to these, linearized AG codes provide **longer lengths** over the same finite fields (thanks to curves with many rational points) and require **smaller field sizes** for given dimensions and distances. This overcomes the key limitation of Reed–Solomon-type codes, which demand large field extensions for long code lengths. | | --- | | ## 7. Asymptotic Goodness and Beyond | | By considering towers of curves with many rational points, one constructs infinite families of linearized AG codes with asymptotically positive rate and relative distance, hence proving their **asymptotic goodness**. Even stronger, when the field size is sufficiently large, these codes strictly improve on the random coding GV bound in the sum-rank setting. This demonstrates that geometry-driven methods remain a source of asymptotically optimal constructions in modern coding theory. | | --- | | ## 8. Broader Perspective | | The emergence of linearized Algebraic Geometry codes marks a conceptual advance: | | * They extend AG code theory to noncommutative algebras (Ore rings). | * They unify and generalize classical Reed–Solomon and Gabidulin families. | * They provide explicit and implementable constructions with strong parameter guarantees. | * They surpass probabilistic bounds asymptotically, reaffirming the power of algebraic geometry in coding. | | This development thus positions linearized AG codes as a central object for future research, bridging noncommutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and information theory. | | --- | | |", "checklist": "1.

Variance Decay Property | | From the definition of the backward map and Jensen’s inequality, | \\mathrm{Var}\\nu(y_0(X_0)) \\;\\leq\\; \\mathrm{Var}\\nu(\\gamma_T(X_T)). | | This is the variance decay property: the variance at the initial time (backward-projected) is always smaller than or equal to the variance at the terminal time. | | This property shows that variance contracts along the backward map. To obtain exponential decay, we need a structural inequality that quantifies this contraction — the Poincaré inequality. | | Step 4. Embedding into BSDE Optimal Control | | The variance decay is formalized by embedding the backward map into a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE): | -dY_t(x) = \\Big[(A Y_t)(x) + h(x)^\\top(U_t + V_t(x))\\Big] dt - V_t(x)^\\top dZ_t, | \\quad Y_T(x) = \\gamma_T(x). | | The associated cost functional is | J(U) = \\mathrm{Var}\\nu(Y_0(X_0)) + \\mathbb{E}\\nu\\left[\\int_0^T \\ell(Y_t,V_t,U_t;X_t) dt\\right], | with running cost \\ell(y,v,u;x) = \\Gamma y(x) + \\|u+v(x)\\|^2, where \\Gamma is the carré du champ operator of A. | | This control problem reveals that variance decay is equivalent to optimality of the controlled BSDE system. | | Step 5. Poincaré Inequality for Nonlinear Filters | | For a Markov process with invariant distribution \\bar\\mu, the classical Poincaré inequality is: | \\bar\\mu(\\Gamma f) \\geq c \\,\\mathrm{Var}_{\\bar\\mu}(f), | where c>0 is the Poincaré constant. | | In the nonlinear filter setting, an analogous inequality is defined for the dual BSDE system: | \\mathbb{E}\\rho\\Big[\\int_0^\\tau \\pi_t(\\Gamma Y_t) + \\|V_t\\|^2 + |V\\rho(h,Y_t)|^2 \\, dt \\Big] \\;\\geq\\; \\beta_\\rho^\\tau \\,\\mathrm{Var}\\rho(Y_0(X_0)). | This inequality ensures that variance contracts at rate \\beta\\rho^\\tau, giving a filter-specific Poincaré constant c_\\rho. | | Step 6. Exponential Decay of χ²-Divergence | | From the variance decay inequality and the PI, one derives: | \\mathbb{E}\\mu[\\chi^2(\\pi_T^\\mu \\| \\pi_T^\\nu)] \\;\\leq\\; \\frac{1}{a}\\, e^{-c(T-\\tau)} \\,\\chi^2(\\mu\\|\\nu), | where a = \\mathrm{ess\\,inf}{x\\in S} \\gamma_0(x). | | Thus, χ²-divergence decays exponentially, proving stability. | | By known inequalities: | \\chi^2 \\text{-stability} \\;\\;\\implies\\;\\; \\text{KL-stability, total variation stability, and \\(L^2\\)-stability}. | | Step 7. Connection to Model Properties | | The positivity of the Poincaré constant is tied to structural properties of the HMM: | 1. Ergodicity of the hidden process: ensures variance contracts due to mixing in the state dynamics. | 2. Observability of the observation model: ensures distinct states produce distinct observation statistics. | 3. Non-degenerate noise: ensures information in the observations is not lost. | | In finite-state HMMs: | • Ergodicity (irreducibility + aperiodicity of the generator), | • Observability (observation matrix full rank), or | • Detectability (all unobservable modes are stable) | → each implies c_\\rho > 0, hence stability. | | Step 8. Broader Interpretation | • The variance decay property generalizes the Kalman filter’s covariance decay to nonlinear filtering. | • The new PI unifies previously separate ergodic and observable cases. | • The framework yields not only qualitative stability but also explicit convergence rates, important for algorithm design (e.g., particle filters, reinforcement learning in partially observed systems). | | Final Conclusion | | By reformulating nonlinear filtering through minimum variance duality and BSDE control, introducing the variance decay property, and defining a Poincaré inequality for nonlinear filters, we obtain a complete framework for stability. | | Result: Under conditions of ergodicity of the hidden Markov process, observability under white-noise measurements, and non-degenerate noise distributions, the χ²-divergence between filters with different priors decays exponentially.

Preliminaries | | * Unnormalized filter $\\sigma^\\rho_t$ vs. normalized filter $\\pi^\\rho_t$. | * Conditional covariance $V^\\rho_t(f,g)$ as variance measure under the filter. | * Carré du Champ operator $\\Gamma$ captures local variance from the generator $\\mathcal{A}$. | * Itô–Wentzell formula enables dynamics of processes $Y_t(X_t)$. | | ### 2. Conditional Variance SDE | | * Target: obtain SDE for $V^\\rho_t(f,Y_t)$. | * Path 1 (Optimal Control): use Hamiltonian duality, momentum process $P_t$, and Itô’s rule. | * Path 2 (Filter Dynamics): apply Kushner–Stratonovich to covariance definition. | * Both approaches yield the same SDE, confirming variance decay dynamics. | | ### 3. Likelihood Ratio Connection | | * Show BSDE solution $Y_t$ acts as likelihood ratio for the filter. | * Uniqueness of Itô representation forces optimal control $ U_t^{(\\text{opt})}=0$. | * Hence $Y_t(x)=\\mathbb{E}^\\rho[F(X_T)\\mid \\mathcal{Z}_t, X_t=x]$, proving likelihood ratio property. | | ### 4. Poincaré Constant | | * Define $\\beta^\\rho_\\tau$ as minimal energy to sustain unit variance. | * Existence follows from weak compactness (Banach–Alaoglu). | * Continuity established via norm equivalence across measures. | * Provides quantitative bound linking energy functional and conditional variance. | | ### 5. Markov Property and Inequality | | * Optimal control BSDE inherits Markov structure. | * Energy functional conditional expectation reduces to a Poincaré inequality. | * Leads to key inequality: expected future variance is exponentially bounded by present variance. | | ### 6. Variance Decay Theorem | | * Case 1: Uniformly integrable likelihood ratio → variance decays in expectation. | * Case 2: Vanishing Poincaré constants → variance tends to zero almost surely. | * Core message: filter variance always decays under these structural conditions. | | ### 7. Positivity of Poincaré Constant | | * For ergodic, observable, or detectable HMMs, assume $c_\\rho=0$ leads to contradiction. | * Therefore $c_\\rho>0$, guaranteeing non-trivial variance decay. | | ### 8. Filter Stability Theorem | | * With $c_\\rho>0$, conditional variance $V^\\nu_T(\\gamma_T)\\to 0$. | * This implies convergence of $\\pi^\\mu_T$ to $\\pi^\\nu_T$ in total variation norm. | | ### 9. Key Assumptions | | * Equivalent initial measures ensure likelihood ratio well-defined. | * Finite-state space simplifies Γ operator and TV distance. | * Lipschitz coefficients guarantee unique solvability and boundedness. | | ### 10. Linear Case Sanity Check | | * For Gaussian linear systems, framework reduces to classical Riccati equation. | * Poincaré constant coincides with observability criterion. | * Confirms general theory recovers Kalman filter stability. | |"}
